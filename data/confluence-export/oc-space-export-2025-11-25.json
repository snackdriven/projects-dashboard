Screen to request more information, or explain why?\n\n Read Only and click to 'Edit' button for text fields. Make it clear which fields can be edited.\n\n Case status: consider including a status on mobile dashboard. Quick Action button that changes according to status (Arrived, Clear, etc.)\n\n Simplify view of case page. No need for 'Current Case'. \n\n Make 'Messages' more prominent.

    "content": "Zoom meeting 1:30-2:30pm\n Attendees\n NAMI Staff\n Mariam Harris, Warmline Director\n\n Evan Cagle, IT, \n\n Stephanie Alvarez, Operations manager\n\n Lisbeth Bustamante, Admin assistant\n\n Chorus: Armen, Julian, Xuan\n Orange County: Flor, Bhuvana, Timothy Sigafoos, Sharon Ishikawa\n Agenda: Discuss NAMI warm line, tech/workflow needs, and OC Navigator project \n NAMI has used iCarol for the past 10 years. They like it but it has many limitations. Very open to changing to the Navigator. \n\n Armen gave an overview of the Navigator. We want to understand how to make this better than iCarol and work better for WarmLine. \n\n MH : We use iCarol to log inbound calls. Vast amount of resources. They get attached to a call log. Can receive texts and chats and do follow up. They want customization. Volume is increasing, currently 8k/month. Want a smoother system for resources. Have consistency issues in data in iCarol. \n\n SA: Also use iCarol for scheduling and communications among staff. We definitely need those two features. And RinkCentral, their phone provider. \n\n Flaw of iCarol - hasn't changed anything in the past 10 years\n\n Close to 2000 resources currently. Don't want to migrate all that over because hard to find resourecs. Want the main agencies and each of their programs, not multiple listings of programs. About 500 agencies. \n\n Keyword searches are glitchy \n\n Scheduling\n Calendar on iCarol shows staff schedule, whether they're remote or in the office. Will text staff that they have a shift coming up. If we change the shifts, we can adjust on iCarol and alert the next staff. It's very basic and works for us. We would like a different interface, seamless system. \n\n Mariam would like to be able to send out a email and text notice without the option to reply. iCarol is complicated to manually enter the schedules. Can be time consuming. \n\n iCarol has chat feature and notice feature. Chat feature doesn't work well so they don't use it. \n\n Events page is glitchy. They want something like a whiteboard or virtual bulletin page. Needs bigger font, a reply function.\n\n On Call feature, can track if this is an established versus new caller. Perhaps if there is a profile you can carry call-to-call. It brings up all the calls that person has had so far, calling in with that phone number. There's a button that you click if this is a new caller or established caller. This helps the mentor manually enter this in. Can put all persons' numbers on their profile.\n\n 42 people in OC, 22 FTE. During the day, up to 12 mentors. In 1 hour, we have up to 8. \n\n RingCentral is used for their calls. It's not integrated in iCarol, but would like it to be. That way the number is automatically populated and the profile is pulled up. \n\n Reporting/Dashboards\n Can pull reports from dashboards - how many resources, how many calls came in, what was repeated. Those numbers aren't accurate due to iCarol. The data analyst has to pull the raw data, sorts it out, and then sends it out.\n\n Wants accurate data on dashboard where you can identify the dates, etc. Monthly data, weekly data, six months, and yearly. \n\n Referrals\n Do a warm transfer to the Suicide hotline and language hotline\n\n For all others, we give phone numbers.\n\n Could share history with others, like OC Links. \n\n Wish List\n Integration with phones \n\n When call comes, call log is auto-populated\n\n Flexible scheduling features\n\n Consistent information about resources, and specific information, such as 5150 eligibility criteria to share with other staff. \n\n Ability to label the calls in different colors so lead staff can triage and follow up appropriate. Red for urgent. Green- information. Yellow- etc.\n\n Chat & text functions. Text is connected to the main number. And text history gets logged into iCarol. Allows room for supervisor to chime in or take over the chat, especially in times of crisis. And, when you're chatting or texting, to easily pull a resource and paste it into the chat. \n\n Quick phrases would be ideal."

They wouldn't have to go through the current process (which is unknown to Flor).\n Might be a need for LE to mark that they're moving someone to a bed, but don't have time to input information.

Would need to look into legality.\n\n CAT Clinician\n View CSU bed availability to determine if this is a viable option for the client.\n Work successfully with CSU staff to find a bed for the client\n\n Objectives\n Create a website that reflects the status of a given CSU (Crisis Stabilization Unit) bed availability for receiving partners. The service should provide a live update of open beds, total available beds, and waitlist status.\n User personas\n Proto-personas: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lQWnBDw=/ &rarr; CSU Staff\n Research \n Relevance \n\n https://chorusapp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OC/pages/1195966503/Personas#Professional-Personas \n Admin Support Staff = CSU Staff + CSU Admin\n Case Worker = CAT Clinician?\n\n Archetypes \n Frontline Supporter = CSU Staff\n Auditor = CSU Admin, Law Enforcement\n\n Jobs we want to cover\n Role \n Job to be done \n\n CSU OD + ODOT\n As a CSU ODOT, I need to provide the open bed count on my facility's beds available.\n As a CSU ODOT or OD, I need to communicate who I am starting to evaluate for intake to reduce redundancy with other facilities. \n\n CSU Supr. CCN or Service Chief\n As a CSU Supr. CCN or Service Chief, I need to keep track of the facility's activity to learn trends about activity for process evaluation.\n\n Some history\n note As of July 1, 2021\n In use at HCA CSU\n\n Trained College Hospital Access Department, to begin training week of July 6\n\n Product requirements with law enforcement meeting \n\n As of July 1, 2021\n In use at HCA CSU\n\n Trained College Hospital Access Department, to begin training week of July 6\n\n Product requirements with law enforcement meeting 08 Jul 2021 \n\n As a part of the OC Links project , a dashboard needs to be created to show CSU resources' status.\n\n Current solution, which was not rolled out, was to update an excel spreadsheet in a shared drive on Box. Excel spreadsheet template can be referenced here:\n\n Waitlists not needed\n\n Terms sheet \n\n Notes\n 3/22 Meeting\n CSUs - #2 and #3 are contractors\n County (15 beds)\n\n College Hospital (12 beds)\n\n Exodus (24 beds = 8 child + 16 adult)\n\n Who will be using this? \n On-duty clinician will upkeep the bed board (person answering the phones, doing intakes). Need to establish a number of how many people would need access\n LVTs, LVNs, and RNs\n\n What do users need to see? \n Main Board \n\n They don't need to see funding or names: only what beds are filled and which aren't. Changes hour by hour. CSUs keep people less than 24 hours. Average turnover 8-12 hours in a CSU\n Other CSUs need to see the entire bed board, not just their own page. When a CSU is at capacity, they generate the referral package to another CSU. \n\n Legal Status & Referral Source are pull-down options. Match with IRIS (integrated records information system)\n\n No need for a waitlist. Would transfer to ED if all CSU spots were full. \n\n Pending referral page \n Pending admission into CSU. Once picked up by LE, patient would need an eval by a CSU Provider before being admitted into a CSU. \n\n Additional stakeholder group \n Adding a stakeholder group - law enforcement (LE)\n\n Not sure what views they need to see\n Might be similar to OC Links view (open spots/closed spots)\n\n Goal: if LE has someone and needs to find a bed, they can pull up the info and go straight to what is available. They wouldn't have to go through the current process (which is unknown to Flor).\n\n Might be a need for LE to mark that they're moving someone to a bed, but don't have time to input information. Need a way to 'reserve' a spot. \n Need to prevent multiple LE from showing up to one spot\n\n Solution - Perhaps a simple passcode for LE to access the bed board. WOuld need to look into legality. \n\n Current Process \n communicating by phone and fax. (County and College Hospital). Exodus just opened so still setting up processes.\n\n CAT Interaction \n Cat clinician calls CSU when they have a client who needs to be transferred. CSU prioritizes these clients bc they're out in the field and not in a safe environment. CSU tries to get the CAT clinician back in the field asap. Open to liaison between CAT and CSU. \n\n Need to run reports but not sure of scope. Matthew directed us to Nancy (?).

Examples:\n What housing resource helps homeless people? \n\n What program can take the patient right now? \n\n Main problem: they can find resources, but it just takes too long. \n They have a resource specialist who is more familiar with the resources. They want to avoid their mentors assigned to a resource specialist, and that the mentors are able to find resources on their own. \n\n How do you decide which resources to refer to callers? \n It depends on the caller's emotional state. We don't want to overwhelm them with resources. We'll give them 3 and invite them to call us back. \n\n We have our top 25 ones we promote often. We have a good relationship with the agency and know they do good work.\n\n Stephanie shared her iCarol screen \n Could sort resources in alphabetical order and by proximity\n\n Sharing resources\n Could save as pdf but don't do that to avoid info overload\n\n Currently, they copy paste information into the NAMI Warmline gmail account and send it to the caller.\n\n They want to be able to send information within the OC Navigator\n they want to just put in a person's email or phone and it sends the whole thing to them. \n\n How are resources updated and verified? \n Current steps\n Within iCarol, staff can view which resources haven't been verified in the past month or year, and mass email those agencies to update within 30 agencies. \n\n Programs would then update their own information. \n\n If they don't update within 30 days, the resource specialist updates it. We'd like the same feature, where it auto-mass emails resources that haven't updated. \n\n Wants: \n A similar process to their current method.\n\n Quality information\n\n Eligibility Information \n Current:\n Basics: age and gender. No detail, such as geographic area\n\n Mentors always tell callers to double check with the program.\n\n How do you share resources with the caller/texter? \n For the most part, give them resource info over the phone or email. \n\n We can text through the iCarol chat system if the person initiated the conversation through text. \n\n What resource information do you share with the person? \n Name of agency, phone number, hours (especially if urgent)\n\n If over email, they'll add a short description. They'd never send a full description bc it'd be overwhelming. \n\n Other features that are helpful? \n 'Recommended Referrals' related to the resource being viewed (automatic based on the description entries, and also based on other mentors' past activity) and \n\n 'Attachments' such as a brochure or other document\n\n Would be helpful to highlight changes that were updated on resource pages\n They send updates on agencies weekly to staff. They send updates on resource every 6 months. \n\n Ability to pin resources or mark them as favorites\n\n FAQ for resources\n Where can i get help with housing? What are the next steps for a certain issue? \n\n Idea to make lists for their top 25 issues / questions i.e. what to do in case of emergencies, current events, mass shooting, national help for covid. \n They give them resources, but also steps for more specific issues (see screenshot) \n\n lists would help with speed, can select this list and choose the best fit resources. \n\n Notes/Annotation \n Admin team can leave notes but they don't use this feature. \n\n Experience? \n To become an expert, really takes time and experience with resources, calls, complaints, etc.\n Resource specialist has been with them for years so she knows agencies very well\n\n Senior mentors also know resources well and some of them have used these resources too (they are peers). \n\n Mentors are part time. They don't check email daily.\n\n VietRISE example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QWKqlFjKZsXZaXvBeuaM9WkgwYXHW7VWWD0_jbIhgZk/edit?fbclid=IwAR24Gpz_RLjgD20EJqPZKN4zUx3LpE1MtXL9MsZ0mpSOCixV3EFTZSY3SwU#gid=1363012617 \n Training \n 3 weeks training, each peer has different capabilities. Their experience also determines how many hours they get to work. \n Give them top resources. \n\n iCarol training. \n\n Call listening-in. \n\n iCarol - can attach resources to our call report. Can also do a follow up. \n\n Tracking \n need to track how many resources they've referred to every month\n\n also track how many resources per caller\n\n Next steps\n User interviews \n low vision mentor\n\n hard of hearing mentor\n\n Fully remote - plan to move into a hybrid model in the next month\n\n Stephanie will send us contacts tomorrow. 5/21\n\n All key attendees\n iCarol\n Are there any issues with iCarol searching resources?\n not user friendly. keyword search doesn't use. \n\n resources need to be attached to call/text, able to email/send it \n\n Resources - NAMI Warmline\n 1500 resources, but want to minimize the number because finding what they need is an issue. No categorization. Types of calls vary from day to night.\n Solution: categories, custom lists\n\n 117 \n complete \n Stephanie Alvarez to clean up resources and send an export of resources \n\n 118 \n complete \n NAMI will map out their resources \n\n 119 \n complete \n Chorus to comb through resources and begin thinking about organization, structure \n\n 120 \n complete \n Chorus set up follow up call \n\n Scheduling - NAMI Warmline\n Need to schedule lead, mentor, on-call mentor\n\n Internal chat\n General communication about operations rather than case-based, unlike current CAT project\n\n Timeline\n Concerns: downtime and data loss during transition. An issue for Phase 2. \n\n Pilot with OC Nav\n Phase 1: Use the OC Nav alongside iCarol \n How can we link resources to the call log? They often link to a variety of resources. \n Use OC Nav Share link to copy/paste link into iCarol\n\n Screenshots"

    "content": "1. Executive Summary\n Overview\n Validate conceptually and from a usability perspective current mocks. \n Can users successfully complete tasks that are essential to their role? \n\n Verify usability of mobile designs for conducting tasks related to dispatching of cases.\n\n Understand pathways on mobile for them.\n\n Designs tested: https://www.figma.com/proto/89aOnpdiXgSvjrZOgRAGve/OC-Links?page-id=1653%3A0&node-id=1693%3A22525&viewport=36%2C240%2C0.08368200808763504&scaling=min-zoom \n\n Discussion Guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19hznm-8fuLgKmtBf_o30IOo72ZzIci8ViY9Uvheg4xE/edit# \n\n Usability study conducted April 16 – 20, 2021\n N=6\n 3 Adult CAT Clinicians\n\n 3 Youth CAT Clinicians\n\n User Stories for CAT Clinician \n As a CAT clinician, I want to quickly respond to a dispatch so that I can quickly respond to the crisis.\n\n As a CAT clinician, I want to quickly understand a case dispatch so that I can quickly prepare.\n\n As a CAT clinician, I want to provide case updates to dispatch so that they know the crisis is being attended to.\n\n As a CAT clinician, I want to communicate with the team to update details and coordinate logistics.\n\n As a CAT clinician, I want to find the appropriate resource with up-to-date information so that I can resolve the crisis appropriately.\n\n Results\n CAT Clinicians can accept a dispatch through the UI , but will need a few key details before going. \n\n CAT Clinicians can navigate to and from the dashboard , although the cases in the dashboard were not always obviously interactive. \n\n CAT Clinicians could navigate through the app as a whole, using the hamburger menu. However, exploring the other pathways inside case details was not always obvious to users and many needed to be prompted. \n\n CAT Clinicians need a way to give and receive dispatching for offline. \n\n Details for dispatch brief, case details, dashboard, and resources were mostly there , but could be optimized with more relevant information. \n\n 2. Detailed results\n Miro board for detailed notes from each user interview. \n Video recordings for each user interview. \n Mini Interviews\n User \n How long have they been with CAT? \n What do they use their work phone for most often? \n Hopes and fears around passing dispatch off to OC Links \n\n P1 \n 5 years\n Mainly calls and texts as part of communication with others on her shift, checks email.\n She's unsure how it'll go with OC Links dispatching bc she hasn't worked with them yet bc she's Noc shift. She sees benefit to have more people in field, but also cautious about learning curve during crisis.\n\n P2 \n 3 years\n She uses her phone mostly for communicating with dispatch, hospitals, CRPs, resources, arranging transportation. She both calls and texts.\n\n P3 \n 3 years\n Calls to reporting party, emails, text messages to coworkers, sending ambulance vouchers via Adobe Acrobat.\n\n P4 \n 2.5 years\n She will use her work phone to check emails, group thread text, log into mtgs, token to access to log into Citrix on her desktop. Doesn't use the mobile version.\n\n P5 \n 3 years\n COVID-19 has accelerated their use of communicating by phone, since they're telecommuting sometimes\n Fears about new dispatch process: we've had issues w/ OCLN understanding what we do. \"We understand what we do.\" so easier to dispatch. OCLN need to explain our services. Sometimes they'll go out and call will need to be cancelled for this reason. Ex: parent calling when child has a tantrum.\n Also some details get lost: Ppl not getting correct number or address also an issue.\n\n P6 \n 10 months\n Checking in with dispatch when I'm out, talking with clients and collateral parties (police, family)\n \"Sounds like a good idea, alleviates pressure of having a bunch of dispatches. Gives you more time to keep up on documentation.\n \"Not worried, bc OCLN are doing training.\"\n\n Tasks with prototype\n Task success: \n 🟢 = coped at the first attempt\n 🟠 = coped but with difficulties\n 🔴 = couldn't cope at all\n 💡 = a side idea\n ❗ = emphasized statement—a user gets emotional about it\n !! = the most crucial for a user, described in detail.\n User \n Responding to a dispatch \n Updating case details + location \n Communicating while on the case \n Dashboard \n Resources \n\n P1 \n 🟢 Able to accept\n Wanted to know more information about the example client's medical condition, to determine if CAT should go out\n\n Address should note what type of location it is (school, residence, group home, ER, etc.)\n\n Language should show client and family language preferences\n\n Could be helpful to specify caller's relationship outside of description\n\n Insurance type helpful (Private v. Medi-Cal v. unfunded), determines which paperwork she brings\n\n Better for her to have more information up front. She likes the dropdown. \n\n 🟢 Could update time\n Didn't really scroll on her own\n\n Time stamps different than what she uses:\n **Need to include date as well as time (she works before and after midnight)\n\n Date/time dispatched\n\n Date and time of arrival\n\n Wait time before assessment (for PD or RN)\n\n Assessment start date/time\n\n Assessment end date/time \n\n CYBH doesn't track ambulance vouchers, do so internally\n\n She liked the navigation part. She usually uses google maps to look up location first, then will use her car's navigation while driving.\n\n Noted that she often goes to areas with bad reception, like ERs for example, which she goes to often.\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to chat\n Important for her to be able to chat with the dispatcher directly. Calling important for PHI.\n\n 🟠 She expected to go back to the dispatch brief\n She expected to go back to the case dispatch when she was accepting the call\n\n She thought it was nice to see dashboard, to see who is out in the field. But not a priority for her, she usually knows who is on her shift.\n\n She thinks this view can be helpful to see whether it's a busy night, to see if she'll have to go out right away.\n\n She commonly refers to resources that are county approved.\n\n Description and website would help in overview, as well as phone number in detail view.\n\n P2 \n 🟢 Able to accept\n Easier to read than the PDF\n\n SSN + MRN useful for Medi-cal. More important than the description.\n\n Dispatched &ne; Time Contacted\n\n 🟠 Needed quite a bit of guiding\n She would prefer to have outcomes on the top\n\n She would want to message the dispatcher directly\n\n Did not scroll on her own, would have missed dispatch PDF if she had not been led. Might be too far down for her to edit it.\n\n For disposition, important to include \"call cancelled.\" Also important to provide a multi-select option, in case the outcome is more than one (ex: DTS + DTO)\n\n 🟠 Needed to be guided here\n Did not notice the people icon in the chat\n\n She would expect the phone icon to call the main line\n\n She would want to contact the dispatcher directly\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to dashboard\n Unhelpful to see other cases. \n\n If a repeat case, they might try to see who else is on, for client history.\n\n She would expect to see the cases for the current day only.\n\n She understood hamburger menu.\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to resources\n She liked that resources was blank to start. She is very familiar with resources in the community, so she usually knows which ones she wants to refer to.\n\n The ones she's less familiar with are local food banks or shelters, as they change a lot too.\n\n She thought the resource card was helpful, but needed the hours. Helpful to know how soon they can call.\n\n P3 \n 🟢 Able to accept\n Did not see client's name right away, would bring down intuitiveness rating because of this\n\n MRN and SSN helpful\n\n Liked this brief version view: \"I'm not digging around here.\"\n\n Crisis type not needed, could gather from description\n\n Missing: \n County history w/ client\n\n Substance abuse info\n\n Weapons on them\n\n Propensity to violence\n\n 🟢 Could update and edit time, chat, and go to directions\n Liked the time stamps: \"It's like pizza hut!\"\n \"That's cool. I like that I don't have to check my watch.\"\n\n Liked that the times updated on their own. Important to also have flexibility to edit. She mentioned \"Add\" instead of \"Save\" would make more sense.\n\n For ambulance in outcomes, expected a dropdown because they only work with a few.\n\n Important to provide more than one option for disposition\n Dispositions used:\n 5150 (adult)\n\n 5585 (child)\n\n 6000 (voluntary)\n\n DTS\n\n DTO\n\n GD\n\n Successful diversion (not hospitalized)\n\n Call cancelled\n\n No one at scene\n\n Uses Waze to look up directions. \"I'm not the best with directions,\" important for her to look up directions.\n She usually has to call the caller before going to confirm address. Happens often enough that address is incorrectly entered.\n\n She personally always starts from the office because she lives far away. She would print the PDF form before going.\n\n 🟠 Could chat, but contacting directly had weird navigation for her.\n Noted the flow of going back from profile to chat was not intuitive\n\n Currently rare for them to contact an OC links navigator.\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to dashboard\n She liked seeing all of the current cases. She understood the filter.\n\n It would be helpful to see any pending cases and where they are. This would help for her to plan ahead, if she can have dinner yet, where she's going\n\n She liked seeing the status update. Didn't seem to notice the progress bar below.\n\n She thought the dot meant there was an update, something's changed.\n\n She noted that they don't usually use client's initials unless it's in an email, for privacy purposes. \"You never know who's looking over your shoulder.\"\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to resources using hamburger menu\n She felt there were too many filters. It could be too much. \"The more I put in, the more it takes away from what I'm getting.\" Wants to see a good array of stuff when filtering\n\n She liked the favorites list concept. Since she often uses the same ones.\n\n In filters, insurance and city weren't very important since adults can travel.\n\n She didn't like that the resources page was blank, she is usually looking for the ones she goes to often. e.g. OC links, NAMI warmline.\n\n Less common resources she'll have to look up: housing, shelter, substance use stuff, job stability, office of family and consumer affairs\n\n The website would be helpful to see what they do.\n\n P4 \n 🟢 Able to accept\n SSN usually not given.\n\n FIN missing. MRN can help, but FIN is what they use.\n\n If it's a residential call, doesn't mention whether police have been called\n\n If it's a hospital, missing bed number and clearance status\n\n Language could be higher up on the page.\n\n 🟢 Understood time stamp right away, and could get to map\n She liked the time stamp feature but thought it would be better for later in the call.\n\n Also thought outcome wouldn't be needed until the end. \n\n Noted some details missing from dispatch PDF, such as FIN, location, and if hospital, bed number.\n\n She will start to do bed search activity form from EHR in the field\n\n They currently double document, she usually does EHR first\n\n She liked seeing the location\n\n 🟢 Understood chat and its features\n Understood people icon\n\n She would want the ability to both communicate with group and the person. \n\n She would want to call and text someone individually. Calling important for PHI, and if she has a lot of info\n \"[In the case] I'm in a really weird situation.\"\n\n She expected to see OD, service chief, and OCLN\n\n She usually contacts dispatcher, rarely OCLN\n\n 🟢 Navigated to open cases\n Noted the filters for cases right away\n\n Noticed the progress bar, understood it\n\n She likes seeing her cases. If she clicked on it and it took her to the full thing that'd be helpful (seems she didn't know it was interactive)\n She would want to see the dispatch form and outcome for a closed case\n\n When she's doing paperwork, she's doing multiple cases at once. So helpful to see in a view like this.\n\n She likes to note the kids' parents' number or FIN\n\n She thought the dot meant it was an open case.\n\n Order of info on the card: she liked caller and client, DOB, and status. May time stamp. Could be helpful to have insurance or language or family language\n\n 🟢 Navigated to resources\n She liked the filter categories she saw\n\n She usually gives out a list of resources\n\n Resource page is a nice-to-have, not a must-have\n\n She likes that Chorus has a list of resources to help become more aware of new resources. Sometimes she'll call the county\n\n She likes prioritization of info, she'd want bed availability on top. Saves her a lot of time to have bed availability.\n\n Likes idea of curated list. \"Cuts down on time I'm searching.\"\n\n She personally likes to have other lists too.\n\n P5 \n 🟠 Did not see accept button\n He noted he could not accept the case at this point. He wanted to know age of caller, to determine if an adult was there. If not, they would need to try to contact them and/or have PD conduct a wellness check\n\n Missing COVID symptoms information\n\n Would be good to note which insurance, particularly if it's Kaiser. They have their own CAT team and are out-of-network for CAT.\n\n 🟢 He was able to use time stamps, ran out of time to ask about location.\n He thought priority order of info was \"about right.\"\n\n He thought arrival and clear times were helpful, noted he has a hard time remembering to note those.\n \"There's something always going on, it's hard to keep track.\"\n\n Noted that for dispatch time, there are various reasons someone would not leave right away. He was concerned about the purpose of tracking this time and how it would be used. \n Noted in EHR, time contacted = dispatched. Different than leaving.\n\n 🟠 Did not notice the chat feature in the design on his own\n He didn't notice the team chat feature right away.\n\n Texting is easier for teammates with him.\n \"To do it twice doesn't seem necessary.\"\n\n He would expect to have in the chat: CAT being dispatched, dispatcher, bed searcher, service chief, and OD if they still have one.\n\n Helpful to be able to contact someone individually, but depends on situation. \n \"If we're missing information then it's important to reach out.\"\n\n 🟠 Did not expect to navigate here, but understood it after seeing it.\n Didn't notice the filters for the other cases in this view right away\n\n 🟢 Navigated to resources\n Usually refer to same CSUs and outpatient programs, 80% of the time\n Usually, he's looking up for a parent/child. He's writing it down for them, on a disposition form. Regional outpatient centers on there, but there's more\n\n Wondered about personal customization of a list. Or saved resources on a page.\n\n Likes the idea of having resources all in one place. \n\n Information helpful\n He liked resource info. Phone # and address are most important.\n\n He likes bed availability. Usually refers to a crisis residential unit based on availability. Usually has to call.\n\n On details page, he suggested a description. Maybe a notes section. \"But most of it's here.\"\n\n He didn't expect to be able to tap into it to find details.\n\n P6 \n 🟢 Able to accept\n Wanted to know more information such as:\n weapons on them\n\n substance abuse history\n\n hospital history\n\n medical history\n\n diagnosis/diagnoses\n\n medication\n\n Would want to also check with client about:\n Insurance/Medi-Cal\n\n What client is doing exactly at that moment\n\n Substance abuse\n\n Weapons\n\n 🟢 Understood the case details and location pages, and their functionality.\n Initial impressions: assumed it was the CAT tab from Chorus\n\n Suggested putting case updates info into chronological order, which would be:\n Dispatch PDF\n\n Time stamps\n\n Outcome\n\n For time stamps, she correctly guessed how it would work. She expected to add live time and be able to edit it.\n Noted that inputting time this way would take some getting used to.\n\n Outcome: she would edit as she goes, all at once would be easier bc less steps. She usually notes as she goes along. She doesn't do voucher from the field.\n\n Address is nice and clear, \"I can put it into my app.\" Wondered if it would be an interactive map.\n\n Time stamps she uses\n Dispatched = time clinician left.\n\n Arrival = time you got to scene\n\n Assessment = how long you spent w/ the client\n How long she speaks on the phone\n\n How long she speaks to client face-to-face\n\n How long it takes to drive to hospital or the scene\n\n How long she spends at hospital\n\n How long she waits for ambulance or PD\n\n Clear = when done\n\n 🟠 Needed to be led here, did not expect to have this feature.\n Had no expectation of what would be in there\n\n She would contact CAT colleague to look at EHR\n\n She would often contact CAT dispatch, usually talks to them in person when she's in the office. From the field, texting is tough bc HIPAA\n\n 🟠 Did not expect to navigate here, but understood it after seeing it.\n Took a second to notice the \"my cases\" title, not noticeable to her\n\n Info on card helpful. Gives a good review. Likes the age and address.\n\n She doesn't know if she needs to see her recent cases. She keeps her own logs to track. Uses it to track her hours for her license.\n An excel doc the service chiefs gave. She notes: date, client name, disposition, where we are in the case, address\n\n Going back to dashboard was a little confusing for her. She doesn't think she would want to go back to a view like this if she's on a case.\n\n She thought dot meant it was open. She saw the progress bar, understood its meaning.\n\n She liked that the dot was to denote a notification.\n\n 🟢 Could navigate to resources\n Resource - she wasn't sure if she'd use this. Maybe frequent resources would be saved\n\n She gives a resource sheet usually\n\n Thought the category filters helpful, such as hours, accepting new patients, and language. not sure about insurance.\n\n List seems more helpful to have, than searching and filtering.\n\n She liked seeing bed availability, especially in real-time. Would save time calling.\n\n She understood she could tap on it\n\n In details page, she liked seeing bed count with pending, and phone number. But would be good to know what the gender of the bed count would be.\n\n 3. Further actions\n View \n Key Finding \n Next Steps \n\n Dispatch brief\n More information up front is better \n While some info is good to have here, clinician would see want to and expect to see the full dispatch PDF before leaving.\n\n Address should include what type of location it is:\n Residence\n Residence type (house, condo complex, etc)\n\n Hospital\n Bed number\n\n Clearance status\n\n Group home\n\n School\n\n Children and Adult dispatches differ in information \n MRN and SSN helpful for Adult CATs. Child CAT use FIN more often.\n\n For adult, substance abuse, weapons, and history of violence are important details for preparing.\n\n Youth CAT needs to know status of parent involvement, and if not at site, whether an adult is present.\n\n Reorganize information in this view based on what CATs prioritize\n Client name inside \n\n Caller + relationship + if they are an adult (for CYBH cases)\n\n For CYBH: has parent/legal guardian been contacted?\n\n Substance abuse info\n\n County history\n\n Medical history, diagnosis\n\n Weapons on them, propensity to violence\n\n Address + location type\n\n COVID-19 symptoms + if anyone at site is positive\n\n Provide a way to quickly view the dispatch PDF, either by email or a pathway through the page. \n\n Provide different information for Child v. Adult dispatch. Perhaps create a different form altogether, to only display what is relevant for that CAT.\n\n Provide a way for clinicians to respond to dispatches if in an area with low network reception.\n\n Case Details – Case Updates\n Time Stamps helpful feature, with some considerations needed \n Time stamps should include date as well as time, for those that work before and after midnight. \n\n Seemed helpful for many, who are on the go and don't always remember to mark down their times\n\n Outcome should be shown towards the end of their case journey \n Disposition should be a multi-select\n\n Ambulances should be a dropdown, since they work with only a few of them\n\n Ambulance voucher not always relevant for CYBH CAT\n\n Pain-point of double-entering \n Ensure that information being tracked does not cause too much double-entering, like how they currently do in excel.\n\n Provide the ability to both mark current time in time stamps, as well as edit.\n\n Provide ability to not just mark the time but the date as well.\n\n Explore ways to build trust in documenting time stamps. Perhaps include note about how these would be used and why.\n\n Provide a way for clinicians to provide updates if in an area with low network reception, or system goes offline.\n\n Keep track of what information can be automated\n\n Case Details – Message Thread, Communication\n Our chat will likely not be the main mode of a case's communication \n Important for team to make calls, and not text or chat, for several reasons:\n Handling of PHI\n\n Faster\n\n Easier\n\n Contacting the dispatcher/OC Links Navigator directly is important; general OC Links line not helpful because they will get put on hold.\n\n Currently rare for the CAT clinician while in the field to contact the OC Links Navigator.\n\n Most clinicians do not use Skype while out in the field, only when they are dispatching or bed searching.\n\n OCHCA should level-set expectations on how and when teammates should communicate with one another. \n Add a \"Roster\" page, to provide a way for user to contact a colleague directly.\n For OC links Navigator, important for the clinician to contact them directly and not the OC links general line, because it would take too long. \n\n Optional: Explore an easy pathway for calling/texting a colleague, or easy download of OC Links + CAT teams contacts.\n Down-the-road: intranet chat\n\n Case Details – Location\n Location is helpful to see \n Most expected it to be interactive or to open up their own native app for maps.\n\n Many clinicians often call the caller before leaving to confirm the address, not having a valid \n\n Provide information on what type of location the address is (residence, school, etc.), which should be collected from the CAT call.\n Is it possible to validate address via Google Maps API?\n\n Is it also possible to validate the location type via Google maps API?\n\n Later on: Provide a native app integration, when feasible.\n\n Dashboard\n Dashboard of their cases is helpful for logging their own paperwork on cases after. But not necessary for while out on the field. \n Two clinicians mentioned it would be helpful in terms of seeing call volume.\n\n One mentioned pending would be helpful.\n\n Another mentioned helpful to reference if CAT receives a repeat client, so they can see which clinician had the client previously.\n\n Clinicians often thought the dot meant the case was live or there was an update.\n\n Provide heuristic to indicate card is interactive, so that they can go to more details.\n\n Provide same amount of information that dispatchers would see, including \"Pending\" view.\n\n Dashboard usage should also be to remind CAT clinicians about follow-ups.\n\n Create a new GUI to indicate a message notification.\n\n Resources\n Most CAT clinicians refer to the same list of resources, currently a paper form they provide \n Adult form \n\n Child resources \n\n Clinicians refer to the same resources \"80% of the time.\" Rare for CAT to need to look up a new resource. \n\n Information provided helpful, but some noted a description of the facility and their hours would be helpful to see.\n\n Bed Count would be helpful for CAT Clinicians while in the field \n Most CAT Clinicians got excited when seeing bed availability for a resource.\n\n Saves them a phone call\n\n CAT clinicians could navigate to resources, and find a resource. \n Some of the clinicians did not seem to know the card in search view was interactive. \n\n List of resources seems helpful for CAT \n Separate adult from child resources\n\n One noted that she has a hard time looking up, and has sometimes referred clients to call OC Links to help them find more resources.\n\n One noted it would be helpful to see last visited resource in this view\n\n Provide heuristic to indicate card is interactive, so that they can go to more details\n\n Lists or favoriting of resources would be helpful for clinicians, since they often refer to the same set, as well as make it easier to have on hand. \n Distinguish adult from child resources\n\n Helpful to see others' lists, not just their own\n\n Bed Board integration would provide high value for the clinician.\n Explore what this could look like for a CAT Bed Searcher"

    "content": "1. Executive Summary\n\nOverview\n Validate conceptually and from a usability perspective current mocks: \n Can users successfully complete tasks that are essential to their role? \n\n Understand pathways, validating side rail. Where would I go to complete a given task?\n\n Designs tested: Figma Link \n\n Methodology \n Discussion Guide Draft \nUsability study conducted April 16 – 20, 2021\n N=6 OC Links Navigators \n Note: The first participant, Maria, had received advanced training on CAT integration with OC Links. The rest of the participants had not. \n\n User Stories for OCL Navigator \n As a navigator, I want to find a given CAT case to make changes to it. \nAs a navigator, I want to find a CAT given case for reference.\nAs a navigator, I want to track a CAT case to monitor its progress.\nAs a navigator, I want to dispatch a CAT case so that a CAT clinician can rapidly respond.\nAs a navigator, I want to communicate with the team to ensure the CAT case is being attended to and provide help to CAT as necessary.\n\n*Note: The OC Links Navigators have not dispatched CAT yet, only pass off cases to their dispatcher. These tasks will be new to five of the participants (except the first participant, who has received advanced training.) \n Key Findings \n ✅ What worked well: \n Overall, tests showed that both iterative design changes to the current experience, as well as the new flow of assigning a CAT Clinician and referencing CAT cases were received positively. \n\n Participants appreciated larger radio buttons and splitting some parts of the CAT Dispatch form into two columns, making it easier to read as well as complete the form. \n\n Participants loved having CAT Cases accessible from the Dashboard view, as well as a separate side-navigation option to access the CAT Case overview. \n\n ⚠️ What needs improvement: \n Participants indicated that much of their time is spent completing forms , and there could be ways to make this process more efficient. \n Provide address validation or address autocomplete with a map API. \n Optional: Street View embed. \n\n Provide current timestamp automatically in fields, with ability to edit in case time needs to be modified. \n\n Formatting the MRN number field to split the eight digit entry with a hyphen, e.g. '####-####' \n\n Many components of the CAT Dispatch form are left blank because information is unlikely able to be collected from callers (e.g. insurance information, SSN, DoB). \n Optional: Adding a 'Not sure' option for some of the radio button questions can possibly reduce CAT Clinician - OC Nav communication. \n\n Optional: Indicating 'Found' v. 'Not found' for a client's EHR could be beneficial. CAT Clinicians often want to know if the Navigator can provide them with an EHR. \n\n Optional: Adding in cues for users to know which CAT form fields have yet to be completed, but not required to fill out. \n\n New message awareness is still lacking , and participants mentioned often not seeing when someone in Live Chat has replied. Platform allowing, exploring ways to make messaging more dynamic and allowing for sound/flashing notification. \n Additionally, the new message icon in CAT Cases could be made more prominent, perhaps with a color + size change. \n\n The Resources tab in a case is problematic for users: \n Search often does not return desired resource, even when some participants said they adjusted for case sensitivity. \n\n 'Enter' to confirm Search on the Resources tab in a case would be a time-saver. \n\n Participants said they often use the same 10-20 resources, so providing a 'Favorite' list of these options to select directly in this view, rather than having to use 'Search' would be beneficial. \n\n CAT should be automatically assigned as a resource if it is a CAT case. \n\n Follow-ups require entering a lot of duplicative information. Participants want follow-ups to automatically pipe in relevant data from associated case, especially if it contains CAT information. \n The description/narrative in particular should be piped over, but allow it and other fields to be modifiable so updates can be put in the follow-up. \n\n Dashboard should provide a 'My Cases' filter as opposed to the Navigator having to select their own name. 'My Recent Cases' should be 'Recent Cases'. \n\n Detailed task results \n Miro board for detailed notes from each user interview. \n Video recordings for each user interview. \n\n Info importance: \n ❗ = emphasized statement—a user gets emotional about it\n ‼️ = the most crucial for a user, described in detail\n Task success: \n 🟢 = coped at the first attempt\n 🟠 = coped but with difficulties\n 🔴 = couldn't cope at all\n 💡 = a side idea\n Create a new CAT case \n Assign a clinician \n Filling out the CAT form \n Assigning a resource \n Dashboard \n Seeing case details \n Accessing separate CAT nav + overview \n\n 1 🟢\n 🟢 💡- would ideally want to see who was on shift directly in OC Links. But was trained on Tim sending AM email containing relevant information for CAT clinicians. \n 🟢\n 🟠\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n\n 2 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟠\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n\n 3 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢💡 \"EHR records are often not found, but Clinicians will often ask if we have found one. Having a way to indicate that to them proactively without a back-and-forth would be great.\" \n 🟠\n ?? - these aren't really 'My Recent Cases' since by default they are all recent cases, unless i select my own name. Can I just get a shortcut 'My Cases' filter \n 🟢\n 🟢\n\n 4 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟠\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n\n 5 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟠\n 🟢❗ She was delighted by caller and client being on the same page\n 🟢\n 🟢\n\n 6 🟢\n 🟠💡- Current design gathers language information from CAT in flow after assigning a clinician. Needs to know what language clinician speaks to assign, therefore maybe should assign clinician after gather language skills of caller. \n 🟢\n 🔴\n 🟢\n 🟢\n 🟢"

This would describe clients admitted to the CSU who are waiting to be transferred to a different medical facility, however due to lack of beds at that facility they are waiting in the CSU (sometimes for up to a week). \n\n Product update: This is based on feedback from Nicole directly, however we are going to recommend we put this in the description since it is categorically more of a sub-status of 'Accepted/Accepted' \n\n Hospitals should be called specifically in the 'Referral' section. \n Product update: This will be included in the 'Referral Description' field. \n\n Provide funding specificity for MediCare and MediMed. They need A/B /D, i.e .all combinations possible A/B/D. A client can have A/B but not D, or just D, etc. \n Product update: v1 will include this in the Notes section of each case. \n\n MediCal - County Codes: Each county has numbered code. Knowing the code allows determination if insurance can cover costs, provide care to them in other area after they leave OC. 30: Orange County, 19: LA County are most often seen. \n Product update: v1 will include this in the Notes section of each case. \n\n Dashboard View: Prioritize or highlight CAT / PD referrals as these are more time-sensitive and have priority. \n Product update: We will accomplish this through color indicators, but not arrange them to appear above other cases in the pending queue."

Type /date to quickly add the target release date, /jira to link to Jira epics or issues, and @mention functional owners to keep everyone on the same page. \n Target release\n June 30 2021\n\n Epic\n\n Document status\n DRAFT \n\n Document owner\n\n Community engagement\n Bowen, Visith, Sara, Norma, Angelina\n\n Designer\n\n Tech lead\n\n User researchers\n\n Technical writers\n\n QA\n\n Objective\n Piloting the OC Navigator with NAMI Warmline takes a step towards preparing OC Navigator for a public launch in the fall. We'll have the opportunity to work on and test features such as lists, searching, and resource information organization. \n Provide context on this project and explain how it fits into your organization's strategic goals \n Success metrics\n TO DO\n Are their financial incentives or performance metrics built into NAMI's contract with the county? If no formal metric, is there an informal metric?\n\n Do they have data on iCarol? Speak to IT. \n\n Do we have a BAA with NAMI to allow PHI?\n\n Goal\n Metric\n\n Warmline staff incorporates OC Navigator into their work\n If you had a choice to search for resources, what tool would you choose? Why?\n\n Mentors who experience low vision or are HOH can use the OC Navigator\n\n Mentors request less help from the resource specialist while using the OC Navigator. \n ask eeman Reduced number of emails/requests for help \n\n Reduce number of clicks to get to a resource\n via screen share or shadowing session\n\n Does the OC Navigator bring any additional value to your work compared to iCarol? \n\n Encounter less issues than iCarol, such as page load, page freezing, bugs \n ask evan cagle, it \n\n Reduce call time for mentors \n They can talk to more people. This might not be useful to measure since mentors might need to do double work. Might also be hard to measure. \n\n Assumptions\n List any assumptions you have about your users, technical constraints, or business goals (e.g., Most users will access this feature from a tablet) \n Enabling users to create curated lists will:\n a. improve the dissemination of information about resources between staff\n b. add additional information about what resources are relevant\n c. improve the speed of finding relevant resources for specific cases\n\n Enabling users to add notes/messages to resources will increase the amount of specific details and local knowledge about a resource\n\n Enabling viewing of recently active resources/lists/messages will improve the dissemination of new information to staff\n\n Milestones [draft]\n Use the roadmap planner (/roadmap) to help your team stay on track.

Can use like {my.last_location = _getlocations} for example.\n\n Considerations:\n Think through how to handle cases where location not available and/or access denied\n\n Do we inform the frontend that access was denied and then be able to handle that situation gracefully?\n\n Can integrate into the GUI in \"Save Data\" modal as a shortcut function. On the dropdown where you select what field to save in frontend to backend, we have ability to add these shortcuts and can display it as \"Client's current location\" (so that author doesn't need to use the expression above directly).\n\n User Story: Address Autocomplete\n As a client, I want to see auto-suggested addresses as i type. As an author, i want to save the address, along with lat/long coordinates. \n note There are three ways to handle saving address data. First, we can save plain text in a \"Text\" type field in tables. Second, we can save as plain text but also include lat/long coordinates in json-style formatting and handle the display of that data gracefully if author wants to just show address for exmaple. Or three (prob best way), we can create a new field for tables if needed called \"address\" type. This would enable us to automatically call a function to get long/lat on save entry to this field. We could also then build in a function to split different things about the address as we do for other fields. For example, we could do things like\n {my.address} <returns regular address>\n\n {my.address.coordinates} <returns lat/long coordinates>\n\n There are three ways to handle saving address data.

Or maybe clients token after certain number of requests?\n\n What are the cost implications for using this service from mapping provider?\n\n If address not found, need to make sure that custom address can be entered (also what about suite numbers etc do those mess this up?)\n\n User Story: Get Travel Times\n As an author, i want to display the travel time between two addresses. \n note Could create a function like {_gettraveltime(address1, address2, options} whcih would call an API service like google maps to return the trvel time in minutes. Or also {_gettraveltime(_getlocation, address2). Depending on options in API, those can be exposed in options parameter for example things like travel mode, toll rods ok, etc. This function can be exposed through the GUI so the {} function is not needed to be called by an author depending on where it is used. Would just need an input for the two addresses and then settings for options if available.\n\n Could create a function like {_gettraveltime(address1, address2, options} whcih would call an API service like google maps to return the trvel time in minutes.

Basic things include center point, zoom level and table containing the items to plot. Will have to think through options for marker image. Also, what about if user clicks on marker, does it go directly to a page (similar functionality as \"List View\" feature currently implemented) or does it show a tool tip style box with info on what the marker represents and a button there for the user to click to go to that detail page if needed. Generally, it can function the same as List View and Forms List to handle saving what item was clicked and exposing it on the next page for example. All that functionality already exists.\n\n We have basic version implemented in code now, simplest would be a GUI wrapper to this code so author doesn't need to know the code to type.

What would you keep? \n\n Section D: iCarol Benchmarking and OC Nav Satisfaction Measurement \n\n Weekly Survey Questions [Archive] \n Please rate finding resources on iCarol on a scale of 1 - 5, where 1 is 'very difficult' and 5 is 'very easy'. \n\n Please rate sharing resources on iCarol on a scale of 1 - 5, where 1 is 'very difficult' and 5 is 'very easy'. \n\n On a scale of 1 - 5, where in 1 is 'very unsatisfied' and 5 is 'very satisfied' how satisfied are you with iCarol's current system of resource listing and navigation? \n\n Hard-metric: how many times did they reach out to Eeman for resource assistance? \n\n How many cases occurred in a week? How many needed resource help? \n\n Would you recommend OC Navigator to a friend or colleague? \n\n Phase 2: Concept Testing, Lists, Resource Cards and Organization [WIP] Phase-2-Concept-Testing,-NAMI \n\n Research Objectives (Priortize) \n 1. Understand the use cases for how and why they would use a list , as well as test usability for each concept , and see how different approaches to List-making perform with users.\n Learn what paper materials akin to a list they might have - ex: binder, sheet of paper, notes. \n If they have this, can they show us?\n\n Validate terminology. \n \"Follow\" v. \"Save\"\n\n \"List\" v. \"Collection\" \n\n Types of list: process-focused (e.g. step 1, step 2) - geographic specific, program-centered, etc. What types of list (mental or on paper / digital) do they reference when making a referral?\n\n Attaching documents to resources? Is this useful? \n\n 2. Understand if users are comfortable with replacing: \n FAQ Section with Lists \n Subcategories with Lists\n Lists as parts of lists - what building blocks could surface at the list-level? At the search level? \n 3. Learn what kinds of content they would wish to discover . \n How best can we help other staff members discover new resources + lists? \n Use Cases: Disaster specific resources, pinned resources, etc. \n\n How does this inform what sorts of list they'd wish to see? E.g., most popular, recently viewed, etc. \n\n 4. Note-taking: private notes: what are they currently doing at this level (digitally and analogue)? At the resource and list-level. \n Potentially Out of Scope Goals: \n 4. Validate hypothesis that current design concepts of resource navigation can support mentors' tasks of finding a resource for clients.\n 5. Landing Page - after login, where should they end up? Dashboard v. OC Resource Navigator Landpage. NAMI will always be gated by login. \n NAMI specific : is there a need for a Landing Page? \n\n 6. Understand what content they'd want to see on the 'Dashboard' v. 'Resources' pages. \n In the 'Dashboard', what is more helpful to see - a list of most commonly used resources, or resources that have been referred most recently by the logged in staff member? \n Understanding how they'd ideally track referrals from prior calls, reporting, etc. \n\n Concept Testing - Discussion Guide, Phase 2 \n Part 1: Foundational questions / List-making \n What personal lists of resources do you refer to, if any? Where are they currently stored?\n Do you make any mental lists of resources? \n Prompt if needed: E.g., when I know someone needs a certain type of service in a particular area, I know these resources exist and think through them before deciding on an appropriate service. \n\n What uses might you have for creating a list?\n\n In a given day, how many resources do you typically navigate between / view / refer in iCarol or other sites? \n\n Currently in your workflow, when do you login to iCarol? Do you find yourself logging in at the beginning of the day or when you need to find a resource? \n\n Do you track referrals in a call-by-call basis or do you update this at the end of the day?\n\n Part 2: Concept Test - Dashboard \n Now I will show you some designs, they aren't set in stone, etc etc. \n Please go ahead and walk me through what you're seeing on this page. \n\n What does Latest Updates mean to you - how do you envision this could be used by the NAMI team? \n\n What style of find resources do you use now? Could you envision yourself using Lists or Nav or Search. When might you use each one? \n\n Transition: Show me how you might create a group of resources related to _______Family member arrested example______\n\n Part 3: Concept Test A - Lists Page and List Creation \n Walk me through what you're seeing here on this page. \n How many resources would you expect to see in this 'List'? \n\n What does 'Attachments' mean to you - is this relevant for your usage of a tool like thisWhat sort of forms do you usually work with? \n\n How often do you refer to a map view, if at all when referring resources? How often do you work with resources where location is irrelevant (e.g. a digital only resource) \n\n Are these tags below the map view useful for you? How would you imagine using them?\n\n What do those icons in the side of each card in this list indicate to you? Do you ever search by category when looking for resources currently? When might you do that v. search or other ways to find a resource? \n\n Teleheatlth \n\n What information would be helpful to see in each resource card of this list? \n\n Please take me through what each of these boxes at the bottom of the screen indicate to you? When might you use each of these three text input boxes? \n\n Do you ever take private notes, either on paper or digitally? When might you do that v. sharing a public comment on something?\n\n Do you ever suggest changes to current resource listings - have you ever wanted to do that? What changes might you want to make? \n\n Concept Test B: Click here for alternate view. \n Now I'm going to show you a similar page that also is how you might look at a 'List' of Resources. \n What are your initial thoughts about this concept compared to the page you just saw? \n\n Walk me through what each of these subheadings mean to you - how might you envision using each of these (e.g. Files, Notes, etc) \n\n Prompt about map. \n\n Wrap-up \n I'll go through and click Concept Test A. \n Show me how you would 'Save' a list. Why might you do that? \n\n 2. Now let's say you wanted to look at a Resources only page. How does this differ from the landing page with the Clouds? Do you prefer on over the other? \n Rough Notes: User Interviews, Phase 2 \n June 10th and 11th \n Notes from P1: \n\n Notes from P2: \n Peer mentor \n 2 years \n 20 calls per day\n Wants SMS of resource and information\n Categorization - taxonomy of iCarol doesnt surface relevant results, \n City is ok, zip code is preferred. Sometimes zip code is privacy sensitive for callers \n Track - rare resources \n\n Notes from P3: \n 15 years working in support services - been at NAMI for five years, was on board of directors. \n \"a caller wanted to know if I can refer her to any psychiatrists who specialize in X, and X provides no hits. but we do have links to the OC Psychological Association and also the Psychiatric Agency, the blurb on each is so minimal - i don't even know what they do. I end up just giving them the website, and can't provide the caller much info beyond that. \n \"Add a Resource\" - would be super valuable. Not just edits. \n Doesn't currently use the Subcategories, doesn't use Favorites, just only uses Searches. \n\n Doesn't write down or use lists on paper or digitally, but could see how guides could be valuable. \n Search by comments? Filter by comments? \n Housing will need a lot of breakdown. Apparently LA county has a list of below market rentals, above section 8 in quality. \n Service area: our database sucks for LA county, but we serve people in that area more and more. \n Around 30% of my callers are from LA county \n Around 75% time doesn't share resources\n Works day shift. \n Doesn't have an email, doesn't use forms. \n Wants SMS. \n WANTS BETTER RESOURCE DESCRIPTIONS! THIS IS A HUGE PAIN POINT FOR THIS PERSON. \n For resource card, bullets, service area is sometimes more important than the city itself. \n doesn't ever use digital resources but would more if he could SMS people."

These users mentioned they don't need it, they didn't see the need for it. Went off topic a lot.\n\n Family & support system will help them use it often.\n\n Range of function, depending on state and time.\n\n Ideal = speaking with someone who has experience with a situation, either directly or indirectly. Not the actual 'in-crisis' person.\n\n Recommendations\n 2-3 interviews, 3-4 hours max, prescheduled. Pilot very simple activities. \n\n Figure out protocol for emergencies with Wellness Center\n\n Bowen offered to give Brendan + Courtney 2x 45m training"

Section 230 reform is gaining clout, and looms on the horizon. This will likely impact many tech companies by creating more liability for them. What those liabilities will be, we will need to look out for.\n\n Recommendations\n Enable analytics on the website to learn about behavior patterns. This will help to inform decisions about edit permissions and how resources are referred to.\n\n Provide incentives for organizations to keep their information up-to-date. Competitor examples include:\n Increased traffic\n\n Data analytics\n\n Explore the content moderation model of One Degree and Aunt Bertha, to give the most increased changes of updates, while QA'ing for data integrity.\n\n Explore mobilizing a volunteer workforce to check and update resources\n\n Notify admin user of Navigator when a resource hasn't been updated in a given time period, ex. 6 months or 12 months since last update\n\n Lists + Favoriting | Key Takeaways\n Dovetail link \n Recurring Themes\n Ready-made public lists appeared as a secondary or tertiary pathways to find content lists. \n Search, recommendation engine, or categories/filters are more often featured as the primary starting point to finding list pages. \n\n When a competitor had a ready-made public lists, they were community-generated. \n E-Commerce competitors utilize a merchandised-display page if curating their own set of items to browse through.\n\n When searching for a list of things in a given location, competitors often display a list alongside a map , for desktop.\n On mobile, user can toggle between the two views, with list view being the default\n\n The permissions of the list, or deciding whether to be a publicly available list, truly depends on the user's context . With our direct competitors, almost all defaulted to a private sharing setting.\n\n Recommendations\n Conduct UXR to further understand the user journey of utilizing a resource website to identify the appropriate point to introduce a curated resource list. \n\n Similar to how eCommerce merchandises content for the occasion, we can explore design ideas for a curated resource list that would provide the appropriate balm for the emotional experience* of the user.\n Use UXR to further dive into identified user groups to better understand the details and nuances of their journeys (e.g. finding resources for immigration help v. childcare), and identify stress cases. \n\n Design Next Steps\n Decide on when to utilize community-generated lists v. curated lists\n\n Determine who and when can create a public-facing list\n\n Parse down a list preview UI to essential information only"

Because they need to search the resource in iCarol for gathering metrics and attaching to their call-log, we cannot reasonably expect adoption to be high. Implications for this should inform pilot structure, wherein we test with a small group of dedicated testers and limit them to 'having' to use OC Navigator for a resource for at least 3 calls a day. \n 🔎 Search is important, and ideally Search pulls from keywords, resource name, and location. \nSearch is still something Chorus doesn't do particularly well, and NAMI Warmline staff (specifically more tenured individuals) want to be able to search for specific resources when possible, as opposed to scanning a Favorites list or navigating through categories. \n Search concepts should include the ability to search by zipcode and keyword/resource name, with the ability to assign a Category either at the search level or to filter results after search is conducted. \n ✅ Opportunities \nCurrent satisfaction with iCarol is low, specifically with regards to: \n Ease of use of finding resources including: \n Poor search capabilities\n\n Confusingly formatted categories / subcategories \n\n A vertically-formatted list of 'favorite / most popular' resources that requires a lot of scrolling from the user. \n\n Ease of use for sharing resources including: \n No possible way to link a specific resource, either internally or to callers \n\n No quick way to copy/paste information from that resource to email for sending to callers or other internal staff\n\n Out-of-scope for pilot but received very positively by NAMI staff: Twilio integration to send resource information via text to callers. \nNote: Currently, NAMI staff will read out resource information over the phone, which allows room for error when the caller is taking note of the information, as well as takes more time. \n\n Chat - outside of scope for initial work with NAMI, but iCarol chat is broken and a buggy. Some users avoid it all together out of fear of losing messages. \n\n Dashboard: Users reported general dissatisfaction with design elements and choices, saying that iCarol felt cluttered and ill-organized. A simplified dashboard view - without multiple vertical columns and extraneous information - including Categories, Search, and Favorites should be concept tested in Phase 2 of research. \n\n Additionally, list-making was received positively, Warmline staff when prompted could envision: \n Creating their own list of personal resource Favorites\n\n Viewing lists of known subject-matter specialists at the company. \nSample: \"Susan is an expert on our team in resources in Orange County for LGBTQ support, so she created a list to share with the team\" \n\n Creating lists based on a series of multiple steps a caller must go through to receive support for a specific need: e.g. 1) Go to Social Security Office 2) Go to DMV, etc."

These findings will inform our product improvement plan for the OC Navigator.\n\n Future activities\n ﻿Translation strategy - we will plan to send materials to be translated to you.

Ex: calling a certain resource will automatically bring the police with them.\n This has caused people to turn away from seeking help, due to lack of trust\n\n When going on a website, generally:\n Testimonials are crucial. \"Helpful to humanize the experience.\"\n\n Would rather see a real person than a cartoon.\n\n Concept A \n Guides section – \"Experts\" in title would turn people off.\n\n Likes the way categories are organized\n\n SDoH should go up higher. Very important as people might be unable to recognize they need help. We need to be able to reach that person.\n\n Dropdown copy options could be clearer (doesn't explain where you're going)\n\n Concept B \n Prefers this to A\n A is more aesthetically pleasing, but likes that B is more explicit in actions\n\n Was unclear on what \"search by name\" meant – suggested that the dropdown could go here\n\n Wellness Check-in: can be improved by adding \"Brief\"\n\n Concept C \n Looks too advanced to her\n\n Subcategories are buried. She likes how in A and B there are a few examples of what is under a category.\n\n Need for simplicity and clarity:\n \"I'm trying to think of when I was in crisis mode. People are tired, scared, frazzled. The worst thing is that you're going to be misled.\"\n\n Experience of finding resources\n She is very familiar with looking for help online, as she helped her family when she was abroad.\n\n She found a lot of websites were stale\n\n One particularly bad one was a long list of links that were expired, no way to filter\n\n When we asked about good websites v. bad: \"I just remember the ones that were really bad. We looked them up last summer, and I was shocked that those websites still exist.\"\n ex: 211 is overwhelming\n\n Liked having settings/filters - refine by zipcode helpful, set a 15 mi radius.\n \"Is this for a pregnant woman? The elderly? Youth? You start to lose hope as you scroll down the page, as you've wasted all this time .\"\n\n \"All you can do is rely on hope.\" A lot of the websites felt cold and detached, isolating. Defined a great need for refining, by zipcode or eligibility.\n \" Some of these websites are vomiting up a bunch of links .\"\n\n Overall notes\n Don't make people scroll on the page"

Rather than implementing a rigid hierarchy, tags will be applied broadly to reduce the chance of miscategorization. \n It is important to note that categories are also tags, but serve to group other tags into areas that target a specific audience or help with a specific subject matter. \n Tags as Types \n In order to facilitate better resource filtering, search, and cross-language site capabilities, tags types are required in the taxonomy. \n Categorical Tags (displayed as icon in card)\n\n Service Tags\n e.g: warmline, counseling, prevention, housing \n\n Languages \n\n Population-specific \n e.g: OC Residents, LGBT, HIV, Youth, Elderly \n\n Cost (Fee Structure)\n e.g: Free | Sliding | Unknown | Medi-cal | MediMedi | \n\n Presence\n e.g: In-person, remote\n\n Meta-tags (non-displayed to end-user) \n e.g date source: OC Links, NAMI, other \n\n Categorical Tags \n This will appear on the homepage, as well as accompany resources with an icon specific to each categorical tag they belong to.

Noun tags are singular. Tags can be applied in conjunction with multiple of the 'categorical tags', so there is no strict hierarchy. \n Tags As Search \n Tags will serve the dual-function of being keywords that surface relevant results based on user-search.

These services can encompass mental health, substance use, housing, transportation, and more. O&E case workers have specialties of expertise, as well as cities they serve, languages spoken, and more; there is even a registered nurse who works as an O&E worker.

They do it without police. They may or may not work with CAT, but unsure of frequency. \n\n O&E is in OC Links' division. \n\n \"Not there to poke the bear.\" \n\n https://www.ochealthinfo.com/page/outreach-and-engagement-services \n\n Assumptions\n List any assumptions you have about your users, technical constraints, or business goals (e.g., Most users will access this feature from a tablet) \n The O&E workers work in a very similar way to CAT clinicians, and are similar personas. \n Difference between CAT and OE\n Cat clinicians are rotated\n\n OE: really need someone who knows how each person being served and the appropriate person for them. Needs more of a decision to know who to dispatch.\n OE: may not have an outcome for 3 months. Status could be progressing for awhile. \n\n Want to be able to close a case, but also reopen if that person shows up again. \n\n OE is judged by referral and linkage data. Referral and linkage data is not going to be in Chorus. It'll stay in Access. So they just need the dispatch portion. \n\n Jennifer would like to see some closure of the loop. When case is closed in spreadsheet, Jennifer wants to input a note in case should they call again. \n\n So the OC Navigator can see the outcome and who the OE staff person is.\n\n O&E works will have county-issued iPhones and laptops. \n Confirmed yes.\n\n Open Questions\n Question \n Answer \n Date Answered \n\n To confirm, who will be using this new expansion? OC Links Navigator + O&E worker? Their manager?\n OC Links Navigators will dispatch, and send to O&E OD. O&E Managers would also like to view reports. \n As for O&E workers themselves, we will learn more the week of when we speak with them.\n\n What are the top tasks of O&E worker? As they currently do their work. \n How are they currently dispatched? \n\n Who are they helping exactly?\n\n Goal: link them to services and ID barriers involved to linking them to services (could include housing, transportation)\n Overall goal: link them to behavioral health services. \n\n Can serve anyone in OC at any age experiencing homelessness\n\n OC links takes call. Then sends a dispatch form to O&E OD*. If determined to be an O&E case, then the case gets assigned to a clinician. \n After assigned, the clinician has 3 business days to contact the individual and trying to engage them. Clinicians do progressive O&E until we can open a case for unenrolled services, or unable to locate or flat out refuse after several tries. \n O&E cases might not have an outcome for months.\n Refer to chart Tim created. \n *OD: Officer of the Day/ triage clinician - person assigned to answering calls for the day\n\n What are the top tasks of O&E's manager(s)?\n Reporting on number of cases, number primarily. Also looking at area, and rate of successful linkage to resources. \n\n If closes out, managers update their spreadsheet (track who case is assigned to and what the outcome is). They will try to find out if the person was linked to a program.\n\n How will this project help contribute to the goals of OCHCA?\n Hopefully reduce number of cases.\n\n Is there any existing data on O&E we can reference? \n Currently there are about 6-9 cases/day. They predict it'll go down to 5 cases.\n At beginning of pandemic, they got around 400-500 calls a month. Now it's gone down to about 300 calls a month.\n\n What devices are O&E using? Are they also iPhones from the county? Do they also need to do desk work, on a desktop/laptop?\n O&E workers have laptops, and county-issued iPhones.\n\n Are any additional screener questions required in OC Links? Current question:\n\n Out of Scope\n List the features discussed which are out of scope or might be revisited in a later release. \n Additional portal for OE staff in the field similar to CAT clinicians. Their use-case does not seem to necessitate real-time updates since cases can remain open for 3 months."

Currently have that functionality in iCarol\n\n Follow-ups for OC Links & vice versa\n OC Links and NAMI would like to push referrals for cases to each other or conduct follow ups for each other (requested by Sharon) \n\n Integration with OC Links (requested by Sharon) - For the future roadmap, OC Links and Warmline will seek to better synchronize and hand off calls. It would be helpful if OC Links and Warmline had the same client ID. (Currently this is auto-generated from Chorus)\n\n Internal messaging system with ability to show if someone is online\n\n Audit report\n\n Limit access to schedule\n\n IP address restrictions\n\n Data sharing directly from NAMI to OC Navigator resources\n\n Teams - List of staff by seniority, which would help inform scheduling. Seniority is defined by how long a mentor has worked at the org. Also include hours worked so they can choose the person who has worked less hours, last shift, next shift. (requested by Stephanie and Alma)\n\n Case details - Consider adding insurance information down the road if it's helpful to facilitate case transfers between OC Links and NAMI"

Chorus will lead training on the OC Navigator with users, many of whom are members f the Wellness Center. \n\n Guiding Questions \nAre users finding what they need on OC Navigator, and if not, why? \nIs OC Navigator useful for both members and providers in its current form? \n\n Research Goals: Members \n Validate current design approach from a brand and UI perspective. \n UI: Task completion.\n Search and find a specific resource.\n\n If you were in a crisis: is it obvious where to find more immediate help?\n\n Brand sentiment - Do they feel like the site is made for them as an OC Resident? Is it representative of their ethnicity/socioeconomic group/community/gender etc.? \n\n First time impression - what do users think when they first land on the site. Does it match with their goals of accessing the site? What is the purpose of the site based on your first impression\n\n The SDoH tool: What does an effective UX look like for in-app screeners ? Do people find them useful? How does adoption vary between demographics, if at all?\n\n Capturing the 'uhh' moments: where are users stopping, either confused or otherwise etc etc. Getting the 'why' to inform future design. \n\n Research Goals: Providers \n Validate current design approach from a brand and UI perspective. \n UI: Task completion.\n Search and find a specific resources on behalf of a consumer \n\n The SDoH tool: Is this an effective tool for providers? Do they ever fill it out with members to help them understand where they might help? If not, why?\n\n Content: is content on the site match up with user needs? Are there happy paths to get to that content? \n\n Current User Context: What devices are they using when they interact with OC Navigator? \n Where/what are they doing while they're using OC Navigator? \n\n Methodology \nPrefer to have a combination of the following, time allowing: \n 1:1 user interviews with members\n\n focus groups with providers \n\n shadowing providers as they use OC Navigator in context \n\n Discussion Guide: User Interviews, Members \n Introduction, explanation of test, etc. \n (~Around 5 min duration) \n General need-finding \n (~10 min duration) \n1. Get to know participant, name background, etc.\n2. Dig deeper on their screener response \n Usability Test \n (~Around 30 min duration) \n Have them give initial impressions for app.\n\n complete tasks (search, browse, etc)\n\n Discussion Guide: Provider Focus Group \n Introductions, explanation of Chorus and people at OC \n (~Around 5 min duration) \n Shadowing Guide: Providers \n Introduction, explanation of shadowing, etc \n (~Around 5 min duration)"

So every time you execute a page refresh, the page updates? \n\n Christy - Needs to know where. \n\n Action: to gather images we should use for all 11 category pages\n\n Map \n Last tab just stops. Anything else we can do here? (Armen) \n\n to look into it, but we're doing the same as Yelp\n\n Primary menu \n Will need separate ticket; will remain as is until these new designs are ready to implement.

Yes\n\n Navigation changes can be in phases - styling, then labels/page titles \n\n How may subcategories do we get? 12 in the medical category\n\n What about for when we don't have any results in each tab? Kris will comp this out. \n\n Category descriptions - How can Xuan's team support? \n\n Let's revisit subcategories/subtopics - Need or an area which might be a little different. \n\n Action items\n Schedule follow up call \n\n Send Kris list of subcategories \n\n 1/30/23 Feasibility Review \n Action items\n\n 15 \n complete \n Kris to draft \"online\" guide layout/page \n\n 16 \n complete \n Kris to draft what the detail page will look like for: App, Article, Toolkit, Website, Video \n\n 17 \n complete \n Kris to draft concepts for use cases where tabs have two lines for longer words (translations) \n\n 18 \n incomplete \n Brendan or Angelina to help test \"online,\" \"services\" etc for multi-lingual groups \n\n 19 \n incomplete \n Kris to work on a tab system – double height \n\n 20 \n incomplete \n Xuan to gather support for sourcing images for CARS resources \n\n 21 \n complete \n Mayra to schedule a follow-up session with Kris \n\n Notes\n Can the graphics be randomized on refresh?\n\n Can we anchor a link? Jump to link + have it autoscroll to results\n\n Chorus would have to execute a page refresh. \n\n Can we keep \"Housing Results\"? Yes.\n\n Let's display the categories for each guide. \n\n Would folks know how to translate the resources when searching? \n\n Christy - Let's mush less into the filter, worried about searching by categories. \n\n Xuan \n Category keywords are already structured. \n\n Parent keywords are not subcategories. \n\n Resources are going to be tagged w/subcategories; we will add this into the data structure. \n\n How do we set this up in a way that makes sense for the filters on the page? \n\n UX testing results:\n People liked \"services\"\n\n People didn't like \"group\"\n\n People did not like \"collections\" \n\n If you had a guide with 300+ digital resources, how would we search it? \n Four or five filters across topics\n\n Spread by population \n\n Keywords + search bar \n\n CARS might need to be its own template \n\n We would need to rethink how guides work \n\n Questions for SAs: \n What needs to happen for us to add new subcategories? \n\n What needs to happen for us to break out \"services,\" \"digital,\" and \"guides\" in new filters.\n CARS data will be covered by digital. Anything else we need to think about here?\n\n What needs to happen to make the new filters Kris added in the image to go to the various sections in \"I'm looking for help with\"? \n\n Can we upload PDFs as a digital resource? Yes. \n\n 1/27/23 Preliminary User Testing Results\n What worked? \n\n People liked version 2 more - the one where things are laid out with them more\n\n Most people just want to search by category.\n\n What can improve? \n They run a search, update the city, none of these are helpful - proximity search will help with this\n New design will discourage people to filter by city \n\n Collections - this makes people think of collections coming after them \n\n More filters were coming up better - people didn't know that keyword was a filter (layer a magnifying glass) \n\n Let's test changing the languages a little bit more - Log in a ticket for UX \n Languages icon - Do we want to test also having inside the menu? \n\n Globe icon is too abstract\n\n What is the most commonly used icon to denote language change? \n\n Data stuff - What needs to go in the backlog from here? \n Housing - I just want to call a place.\n\n Medical - a quick filter that makes it super clear. \n\n Wellness Check-in - Everyone skipped it (already has a ticket) \n Take our wellness check -in -Herson style video, explaining what it is. We can redesign. Journey, process, results - \n\n Action items and questions \n Conduct some user testing online (Maze) while Brendan is out - Mayra to create ticket \n\n Walk through with SAs for feasibility - Mayra to schedule with Christy Lee, Kris, Christy Forte \n\n 1/13/23 Concept Review with Internal Team\n Notes \n More humanistic approach? \n\n What are you actually looking for\n\n Collections versus resource guides\n They're lists; maybe down the road we have a how-to; they're all resources, for a demographic\n\n How do we allow the user to select the type of resources they want? \n In person versus digital \n\n We don't just want to mix up different looking cards \n\n Demo\n Could we randomize images in the banner by demographic? - Maybe\n\n Feedback\n Let's reconsider \"my group\" \n\n We should circle back with the Riley Group on:\n Verbiage\n\n Subcategoreis \n\n Proximity search\n Zip code; Issue for smaller cities, they only have a few; Showing at the zip level \n\n Where is this on the Eng roadmap? - Let's add it once it's ready to go. \n\n Submit buttons for the header?\n Confusing to have left items and right, but just needs submit CTA \n\n Confusing to have two filters (top on banner and left at the bottom) \n\n Card sort - Nearest to me would be helpful for community members \n\n \"My group\"\n What about groups that are not specific populations? \n\n This could be a sensitive issue \n\n Let's gather data/requirements from county \n\n We could just surface tags to handle demographics - we just wouldn't label \n\n Or add a \"for everyone\" \n\n Mad Libs\n People love this!\n\n Feedback from the community - People don't like \"keyword\" \n\n People love Online and In-Person, let's comb through the list of \"digital\" - what are we calling online? Like OC Links \n\n Could we add subcategories for the digital resources? (website, apps, etc.) So when people land here, this new filter surfaces. \n\n Action items and questions\n Kris to turn this into mobile \n\n Steps: Kris to create one more traditional and one mobile > Feasibility review > User testing\n\n 12/21/22 card sorting session\n Participants\n Kris, Brendan, Mayra, Angelina, Mayra \n\n Goals\n Card sorting exercise\n\n Identify subcategories for user testing \n\n Notes\n Action items and questions\n Brendan to schedule subcategory review for 12/23\n\n 12/21/22 design working session\n Participants\n Kris, Brendan, Armen, Mayra\n\n Goals\n Working session for Armen and Kris to review updates from 12/20 \n\n We have demographic information \n\n Notes\n Interacting with the page, more user friendly\n\n Fresher look\n\n Subcategories or subtopics? \n\n the needs or the topics were different from the categories &rarr; some of these were more clinical \n If we filter the guides\n\n How do we surface key topics here? I'm looking for help with \"Paying for my housing\" \n\n Fill in the details for content - What are the kind of questions do we want to ask? Example: I am looking to reset my password for my new computer. (spans across different topics)\n\n Can the guides and the search be more integrated? \n Guide topics \n\n When you're searching at the top, you click a guide\n\n Is there some sort of intersection between guides and resources?\n\n Action items and questions\n Next steps: \n Let's list guides for Mental Wellness and Housing\n\n Questions:\n Can we do radius filtering?

At beginning of call: lists mood then at the end of call, must match the same mood\n Cases\n We're redesigning \n 'matching' part is new - Need to follow up and test again in iCarol \n\n Concerns: Has to be Yes or No for Police Called?, Crisis Call? Send to Harassment Line?\n Cases\n We're redesigning \n\n How to View Cases from others (and their notes) confusing, it only shows up in \"edit case\" mode when the case status is \"Open\"\n Cases\n\n Can only read case notes when it is \"closed' status\n Cases\n\n Case Status at the \"Finish\" tab needs clarification. Do we have to put \"Closed\" for every new case? Just submitting as a call report but it says \"Open, Closed, Archived\" I think the drop list should be removed?\n Cases\n These options worked for NAMI when we demoed the designs. Should circle back and ask if they still work post-testing.\n\n \"Type of Contact\" should be required field\n Cases\n This wasn't in the required fields spreadsheet\n Double check with NAMI\n\n Pro: How Chorus lets you know which fields are required before saving case\n Cases\n\n Pro: How to create a \"profile\" of callers populates quickly.\n Cases\n\n At Finish tab, can it be Start and End time both at the same box for easier submission\n Cases\n Not sure what she means?\n\n Demographics doesn't auto-populate for new case made for existing participant profile\n Cases\n We can do this, right? \n\n No \"end chat\" button for Live Chats.

I can talk to Eva/Kris as seems like it's more user friendly. Dominick made the same recommendation.\n I'm up for whatever they decide but their decision should be applied to all OC products and case management systems to create consistency and avoid confusion\n\n Dominick Dominick Martin\n Role \n Peer Mentor \n\n Email \n dmartin@namioc.org \n\n Supervisor notes \n Vision impaired\n\n Note: Items in red shared with Engineering. \n Action items from call with Garrett, Christy, Mayra:\n Action items \n Create ticket for Garret to create some test pages for Dominick (3-4 test pages)\n Wrapping repeating section items in an anchor tag\n\n Changing the entire table into a table\n\n Adding artificial headers within the divs \n\n Mayra to add 5 items on Engineering list \n 2 main issues that Garrett can't fix based on chat from 2//24:\n Pick from lists\n\n Empty buttons\n\n Feedback \n Feature \n Escalated to Engineering? Y/N \n Status/Notes \n Does Garrett have a potential fix? \n\n The follow ups that were listed did not have a link or button that was read by my screen reader JAWS \n Dashboard - Follow Ups \n Yes \n\n Platform-wide issue \n\n Added to Engineering roadmap \n\n Needs ticket \n\n Response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers. \n\n Wrap items in the repeating section; does it have to be href? It might for it be read as a link might just be a tag with a response click inside it. If it doesn't help, Engineering will have to help with response-click. \n\n If Garrett's proposed fixes work, nothing to be escalated to engineering beyond just informing them of what worked so they can apply across the platform for all components \n\n Under the heading titled \"Follow Ups\" the words \"Name / PhoneDueAssigned toSubject\" were read the same as \"Name Field324-324-2342 02/03/2023 11:56 AM\" & \"Garrett M\n Dashboard - Follow Ups\n No\n Maybe we need table headers? \n\n Would divs help?\n\n No eng help needed. \n\n FOLLOW UP NOTES\" (only citing the first under follow ups, but same thing for all of them listed)\n Follow Ups\n No\n Need clarification from Dominick. \n\n Since there is no distinction made by the details being links or buttons, it is a bit confusing about what is clickable.\n Follow Ups\n No\n Need more details from Dominic: \n Is the side nav being coded as links ok? \n\n Interior need to be buttons? \n\n Notes:\n Need to convert anchor tag to button. Let's talk to Kris/Eva about what things should be coded as buttons versus links.\n\n We can ask Dominic about what is clearer for him. \n\n I was able to get to the details of the different follow ups & the other follow ups listed on the page by guessing what to click to get to the details, but I feel this can be made more clear. However, I understand that creating buttons may not be reasonable since what is generated for each follow up will be different and making vague buttons that would be assigned to each follow up generated could be confusing, but making the case number that is generated for each follow up into a link on the webpage, like how it was on Icarol, may be the best way around this issue.\n Follow Ups\n Duplicate for Eng\n Notes: \n Same as response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers. \n\n Maybe we can add some meta data, alt tag that has a case ID. Will need to test if screen reader can pick it up.\n\n Having each follow up as its own individual heading is a great feature for the platform and I am happy to see this is part of it, it will make navigating to the different follow ups with my screen reader much easier\n Follow Ups\n N/A\n\n When in a live chat I had typed in the edit field to message the person seeking support, but the enter key on my keyboard did not send my message. I had to either down arrow or tab out of the edit field and click the button under the edit field. The button was not properly titled (it was read by my screen reader as \"unlabeled 2 button\"). \n Live Chat \n Yes \n\n Platform-wide issue \n\n Added to Engineering roadmap \n\n Needs ticket \n\n Form tag support for text area field. Where they enter the text, it would have to be a single line. \n\n Maybe we can bring to engineering, will need to wrap text in a form area. \n\n Maybe we can format field to be multi-line. \n\n For NAMI, we can fix it, but we want Eng to have a platform-wide solution \n We just need to know what would work \n\n Also, each time I would click the button to send the chat message to the participant, the webpage would jump my screen reader's focus back to the very top of the webpage. I then had to use heading navigation by pressing the \"H\" key to get back to the chat then down arrow/ use the page down key to get back to the edit field. \n Live Chat \n Yes \n\n Platform-wide issue \n\n Added to Engineering roadmap \n\n Needs ticket \n\n Maintain screen reader position on \"stay on current interaction\" \n\n Change how stay on current interaction works. Not sure if it's even possible. \n\n Maybe it got resolved from being able to hit enter; focus on the box \n\n Having the most recent chat message sent at the top of the chat is great since it helps with getting to the most recent message. But then if the chat itself gets longer and longer, using the down arrow/ page down method to navigate could be an issue that disrupts continuity. Perhaps if there was either a button or link that is directly above the chat itself that could jump directly into the edit field would be helpful, but not sure if this is something that can be done.\n Live Chat\n No \n Could we add a jump button? \n\n Similar to skip nav on a webpage. \n\n Would also require a styling change/button.\n\n The edit field for other housing insecurity is good, but I still feel a drop-down menu with multiple options would be better suited for this piece of information.\n Cases - Details tab\n No\n Clarify if he means having a brand new pull down with some options? If so, we would need this from NAMI.\n\n Under the edit fields for name/ phone and the drop down menu for Staff, the link to search for what was entered is titled \"Filter,\" this was a little confusing, perhaps titling it \"Search\" would be more clear.\n Filter vs Search button\n No\n Doable, need to talk to Eva and Kris about labels for consistency \n\n Also, a suggestion for the search results would be each participant that come up from a search being there own heading that pops up would be helpful for navigating, or having the participant's name be a link that would take the staff member to a webpage that has the call history. For example, I had created a case for \"Eric Wright.\" I was able to search using the phone number, the full name, the first name (all individually), but if searching using a name for a participant could list all the Erics in the cases with a heading for each person that could help.\n Search results - Participants \n Duplicate for Eng\n Same as response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers.\n\n Same suggestion when searching on the Cases webpage as the previous feedback point. If searching for callers, participants, phone number, or any combo could provide a list of results that are their own heading or have a link generated for those search results, this would help with navigating with my screen reader.\n Search results - Cases\n Duplicate for Eng\n Same as response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers.\n\n Any page that has edit fields to search with:\n If anytime there is a search conducted the results could come back as either headings or links that would be helpful, especially when it comes to the resources search results. Right now it is manageable since there is only 10 resources and each resource is its own heading I can navigate to the resources using heading navigation, which is way better then how it is on Icarol currently.\n Search results - Resources \n Duplicate for Eng \n Same as response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers.\n Could also be a heading class.\n\n Also, on the Teams page the results that came back when I searched/ used the \"Filter\" button when I searched for myself, my name was not a link that appeared in my links list. The links list and heading navigation are the most efficient and effective ways for me to navigate around a webpage. And when a list of search results come back as links, I can open my links list and navigate using that instead of using heading navigation to get me close then have to down arrow or use the page down key on my keyboard.\n Search results - Teams \n Duplicate for Eng \n Same as response-click not registering as a clickable item for screen readers.\n Could also be a heading class.\n\n Race/ ethnicity \n There are several buttons that are read as \"unlabeled 1 button\" and when I clicked the one under WHITE CAUCASIAN IT JUMPED ME DOWN TO THE DX DROP DOWN BOX FOR FORMAL DIAGNOSIS, BUT I WENT BACK A PAGE AND RESTARTED A NEW CASE AND CLICKING THE \"UNLABLED 1 BUTTON\" THIS TIME DID NOT JUMP ME DOWN TO THAT DROP BOX \n FOR THE IMPROPERLY TITLED BUTTONS, MY SUGGESTION IS TO PROPERLY TITLE THE \"UNLABLED 1\" BUTTONS TO \"CATEGORY OPTIONS\" FOLLOWED WITH AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE, AFRICAN/AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK, ASIAN, ETC. FOR THE RESPECTIVE ETHNICITIES. \n Cases - Empty buttons \n Yes \n\n Platform-wide issue \n\n Added to Engineering roadmap \n\n Needs ticket \n\n Will log this for engineering and Christy is getting on their radar as well. \n\n Checkbox should not register as a button. \n\n MUST GO TO ENGINEERING \n\n ASSESSMENT OF CALLER'S MOOD BY MENTOR \n HAVING EACH ASSESSMENT AND A RELATED DROP DOWN MENU SEEMS UNNECESSARY AND TAKES ME MORE TIME TO DOWN ARROW OR TAB THROUGH ALL THE OPTIONS TO NAVIGATE USING MY SCREEN READER, THIS MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE FOR A SIGHTED PERSON USING A MOUSE, BUT FOR ME BEING BLIND IT TAKES UP MORE TIME THEN IF THERE WAS A DROP DOWN MENU OF THE ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES AND A DROP DOWN MENU FOR THE MORE, LESS, SAME AS BEGINNING OF CALL OPTIONS SINCE WHEN IN THOSE DROP DOWN MENUS I CAN USE FIRST LETTER NAVIGATION TO CYCLE THROUGH QUICKLY. \n Cases - Outcome Measures \n Yes \n\n Platform-wide issue \n\n Added to Engineering roadmap \n\n Needs ticket \n\n We're redesigning \n\n Main point for engineering, it's related to conditional pick from lists. \n\n If they can pick one, then that gives them a list to pick from, that would be ideal. \n\n MUST GO TO ENGINEERING \n\n DID YOU MAKE A REFERRAL \n THERE IS AN IMPROPERLY TITLED BUTTON READ BY MY SCREEN READER AS \"UNLABLED 2 BUTTON\" UNDER THIS SECTION . PUTTING A TITLE SUCH AS \"REFERRAL CATAGORIES\" CAN REMOVE CONFUSION AND THE BARRIER OF THE IMPROPER TITLING OF THIS BUTTON.\n Cases - Resources \n Duplicate for Eng \n Checkbox should not register as a button.\n\n CREATE NEW CASE PAGE: \n AFTER USING THE OPTION UNDER THE HEADING \"SEARCH FOR EXISTING PARTICIPANT,\" \n I HAD OPENED A NEW CASE BASED OFF SEARCHING FOR A CASE I HAD ALREADY SUBMITTED, BUT SOME OF THE DETAILS WERE NOT POPULATING, LIKE THE AGE, REFERRED BY QUESTION, ETC. NOW, THE DETAILS FROM THE PREVIOUS CASE FOR THE PARTICIPANT HAD SHOWN UP ON THE PAGE, BUT THE INFORMATION WAS NOT AUTOMATICALLY POPULATING INTO THE NEW CASE I WAS OPENING FOR THE PARTICIPANT. SOME QUESTIONS SUCH AS AGE AND REFERRED BY, WILL REMAIN THE SAME, FOR THE MOST PART AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY POPULATE INTO THE NEW CASE WILL HELP CUT DOWN ON THE DOCUMENTING PROCESS. THERE ARE SOME PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT WILL CURRENTLY BE PUT INTO A NEW CALL REPORT AFTER SEARCHING A PERSON'S NUMBER AND CLICKING ON \"USE HELPSEEKERS INFORMATION IN THE CALL REPORT YOU ARE CREATING\" ON ICAROL. I FEEL THIS SOMETHING THAT IS HELPFUL FROM ICAROL THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE ON THE NEW PLATFORM.\n Clarify with Dominick: What details should be populating that aren't?\n\n Philip Philip Vogel\n Role \n Peer Mentor/Outreach Specialist\n\n Email \n pvogel@namioc.org \n\n Supervisor notes \n Great with tech\n\n Feedback \n Feature \n Status/Notes \n\n It would be easier if only our follow ups and recent calls were listed on the dashboard rather than everybody on the team. Will the dashboard look different for supervisor vs. mentor?\n Dashboard\n\n I would have preferred if the contact sheet came up right away to \"create a new case.\"\n Cases\n\n I liked how we could search for individual participants by name and phone number, and the graphics of the \"case history.\" I liked how the resources previously accessed were also included.\n Cases, Participants \n\n The live chat function looks way easier to use on this program than on Icarol. 5) Collecting demographic information for chat may be challenging like it currently is on Icarol. One solution for this may be to add \"chat\" as an option for each demographic category drop down menu, with the expectation that mentors will use this option when they are unable to ask a question.\n Cases - Demographic fields\n\n Based on my experience working on the Didi Hirsch suicide chat, we had to ask demographic questions before we would talk to the chatter. However, we had many less demographic questions/categories, and that level of questioning may not be appropriate for a warmline like this.\n Cases - Demographic fields\n\n I really liked how you can filter the staff by language. This function will really help with referrals.\n Team\n\n Patricia Patricia Monroe \n Role \n Shift Manager \n\n Email \n pmonroe@namioc.org \n\n Supervisor notes \n Technologically challenged\n\n Feedback \n Feature \n Status/Notes \n\n I believe that it is a very nice and smart system. Once all of the glitches get ironed out I think it is going to be just wonderful. Just the change NAMIOCWL needs to move on with the times. However, I do have a few things that I found were challenging.\n General \n\n When it says to create a new case it does not take u to the field that u are going to start working on. (I think once it says create a case it should take u right to the designated area.\n Cases \n\n I believe that the term not specified makes for confusion and questions\n\n It is being asked some of the same questions too many times like trick questions for the concerns\n\n Were a new case is made it has assigned to and that makes one think of assigning a follow up.\n\n Where they have * signs for the field that needs to be requiredI think there should be some type of highlight for things that are missing not just an asterisk. It makes it easier to go back and fill in and less time consuming to have to continue looking for (duh) what did I miss.\n\n How do u edit a call report after??\n\n Overall so far I think it is good, but I can't see everything everyone else sees.\n\n Stephanie Stephanie Alvarez, Lisbeth, Dr. Harris call on 2/15\n Feedback \n Feature \n Status/Notes \n\n Positive\n User friendly\n\n Create a case is easy to find \n\n Easy to add case details \n\n Required fields - nice alert\n\n All\n\n Negative \n Confusing when creating a new case \n\n Type of contact - should be required\n\n Checked NAMI case fields vs OC Links spreadsheet and this was not a required field\n Should we make it required? \n\n For phone, add dashes between numbers \n Same as Lisbeth's feedback; tagged Garrett\n\n Highlighting fields so they know which are required. So it's easily to locate. We will ask our team if it's doable.\n Doable; Garrett created a concept\n Let's ask Eva and Kris - Needs ticket \n\n Repeat versus non-repeat caller\n Could we integrate with ring central?\n\n Already talked to Bhuvana \n\n Ring central integrated with iCarol \n\n Ring central can recognize that call requirement \n\n NAMI will have a meeting with iCarol next week/ring central\n\n Let's raise it to the county. \n\n Philip Philip Vogel \n Role \n Will ask Stephanie\n\n Email \n\n Supervisor notes \n\n Feedback \n Feature \n Status/Notes \n\n Positive\n I like how you can create a case with first name as well as phone number or other details and it gives you the option to auto-populate demographics from previous calls.\n\n Dashboard has an interesting design in that it shows all active follow-ups assigned to all mentors. I feel like this may be helpful when dealing with higher call volumes.\n\n I like the \"permissions\" tab on the contact sheet. It will make it easier for us to respond to callers/chatters who violate our rules/boundaries.\n\n The Live chat looks great and is very intuitive. I really like how easy it is to access previous chats.\n\n I really like ux design for the Resources . I like the map (nice touch!). I hope more in-depth written descriptions will be added, and maybe mentors can add into the written description as they learn more details about each resource such as hours of operation and payment/insurance information.\n\n I LOVE the design for the TEAM tab. It is awesome we can quickly and easily find mentors and volunteers based on their language. This is so helpful.\n\n In Followups tab, I like how we have both \"completed\" and \"attempted\" followup listed. This will make it less confusing for mentors fielding calls with people who have multiple contacts but have not spoken with a mentor.\n\n All\n Fourth bullet - Resource data set will be updated to include more information. \n\n It would be easier to put Zip code in and for it to automatically populate location associated with that zip code (city and state) like iCarol.\n Cases \n Follow-up - By location, does he mean city? Right now, we can't quite do this in the platform, but can add to the backlog. \n\n Will we have the ability to see only our recent cases instead of the whole group on the dashboard? Or will we need to put our name through the filter to see our recent contacts?\n Dashboard > Recent Cases\n Yes to the latter. Action: We can also ask Garrett and Patrick for feasibility on displaying only their recent cases on the dashboard. \n\n On the live chat it looks like it only gives us options for OC cities, even if we list a different county.\n Live Chat\n Action: Need to look into this. \n\n In Caller Information on the live chat contact sheet, CALLER RELATIONSHIP TO PARTICIPANT options are actually the options that should be in the Referral tab.\n Live Chat\n Action: Need to look into this. \n\n For Primary Language on contact sheet, an \"other\" option should be listed if the caller speaks one of the languages not listed. Otherwise the mentor will just mark English. Not sure if it matters for our county demographics, just a suggestion.\n Cases \n Action: Need to look into this."

Its social care network features more than 550,000 program locations verified by findhelp's data operations team.\n 2-1-1 Orange County (211OC) links Orange County's most vulnerable with the health and human service resources they need.\n The equity-centered choice\nfor social care\n One Degree provides services to community-based organizations, healthcare, and government agencies.\n Our partners and clients use One Degree technology to power their social care systems: making informed referrals, enrolling people into resources and benefits, and measuring outcomes.\n\n Experience summary \n Some interesting features (collapsable resource details, etc.), and simple to use. Feels like a digital yellow book and boring. \n Overwhelming and busy. It's hard to focus on one items with so much happening all at once. \n Colors are user friendly and some of the features are nice (e.g. subcategories that automatically display under the categories). \n\n Pros/cons \n Simple initial page to just search for resources. \n Additional filters on search results are useful (e.g. Program Filters). \n Collapsable resource cards. \n Helpful CTAs (e.g. Next Steps)\n 10 primary menu items (categories)\n Not much context initially to know/learn about what it is. \n Navigating across primary nav items is a bit jolty/jittery. \n Link farms for some of the primary categories (e.g. Money).\n Category pages don't have have landing pages. \n No people anywhere; not much imagery beyond the icons. \n Resource map is on the left; not a common practice. Usually on the right. \n On category landing page, \"Personal Filters\" is confusing. \n More languages\n Data dashboards \n 10 primary menu items\n Very busy/overwhelming homepage with a lot of things to click on \n Hard to tell what's an image versus a CTA (e.g. 211 chat bubble at the top) \n Not as easy to find a simple list of resources/categories"

If available, include relevant data visualizations.\n Jamie called in Ashok to look at OC links because Engineering had just pushed a release and we were still in the middle of testing post-release and weren't seeing the same issues as OC Links reports. He recommended hard browser resets and to check back in.\n OC still reported issues. Called in more people to help take a look at OC Links\n\n Impact\n\n OC Links staff were unable to use the system. Had to go to paper and pencil because of data save issues. Data on details tab missing\n Support was flooded with emails\n Addie and Xuan had calls from Tim at OC Links\n\n Detection\n\n Around 1:25 PM Xuan received a message that the system wasn't working and gave a brief summary\n At the same time, Support emails were coming in\n We spent about 5-10 mins trying to reproduce and were not successful. Jamie asked for assistance from the Entire OC team and starting a meeting \n\n Response\n\n Xuan, Addie, Jamie and Ashok first responded. \n Jamie and Ashok got on a call to take a look. Ashok was brought in because this was happening at the same time as post-release testing. It was unclear if this was an eng issue or SA issue. We could not reproduce. Ashok gave some ideas. Jamie took 5 mins to test, still receiving reports. Brought in more team members to help reproduce the issues. \n\n Recovery\n\nReport how the user impact was mitigated and when the incident was deemed resolved. Describe how the team could've improved time to mitigation.\n We worked as a team to find the source of the issue. We spent about two hours working on source of the issue to resolution.\n We could have improved this process by knowing what changes may have been done to an interaction. At this time, we have to go by peoples word. In an ideal world, we would have a change log to look at or some sort of activity log for interaction changes.\n\n Timeline\n\nDetail the incident timeline using UTC to standardize for timezones. Include lead-up events, post-impact event, and any decisions or changes made.\n 1:25 Users report issues with OC Links\n 1:30 testing on our end and we can't see the same issues\n 1:35 Jamie and Ashok meet\n 1:40 OC Links try's a browser reset- No luck\n 1:50 Jamie asks team to jump on a call\n 2:01 We decide to roll back Engineering release because we still can't find root cause\n 2:25 We find cause and start to work towards a resolution plan\n 3:00 Addie alerts OC can start to use system again\n 3:15 We are able to put a fix in place and work towards recovering data for OC Links\n\n Root cause\n\n We dug deeper on our side and uncovered that we had removed a hidden field around the same time as release (12:40 PM) which was then \"unmapped\" in the response sets. This \"unmapping\" caused the response set save to fail. This is the first time we've seen a deleted field and subsequent \"unmapping\" cause a response set failure\n\n Backlog check\n\nReview the engineering backlog to find out if there was unplanned work that could've prevented the incident or reduced its impact.\n Is there an eng ticket?\n ttps://chorusapp.atlassian.net/browse/CHORUS-4369 \n\n Lessons learned\n\nDescribe what you learned, what went well, and how you can improve.\n Changes made to prod should never be done without a ticket, testing and notice \n Should have questioned unmapped response set more thoroughly when it was first noticed.\n Don't work on other things while release is happening. We had no stated guidelines around this previously. This is an area where more process/overhead would be beneficial for us, no matter how minor a change is. \n Lots of context switching was involved in and around release time. Team will work on protecting SA's time to avoid context switching and keeping focus.\n Solutions team access to Eng release calendar (and vice versa) so that teams can have increased visibility in terms of what changes are being made and when.\n Roll back: We rolled back the engineering release. We should have taken a more time to look at the platform sites app.join and chorusplat.io to see if their release had any effect on those sites first.\n\n Follow-up tasks\n\nList the Jira issues created to prevent this class of incident in the future. Note who is responsible, when they have to complete the work, and where that work is being tracked.\n h ttps://chorusapp.atlassian.net/browse/CHORUS-4369"

CRPs do not use Chorus yet. We're building CRPs and then going to update CSUs to be consistent\n\n Bed Board (aka Bed Availability Board) \n Shows availability at different programs, so that referrers (e.g., Police, CAT Team, etc.) know if they can refer a client to a program\n\n Referral \n When a client is given a recommendation in writing to a specific service provider for care and treatment\n\n Linkage \n Client participates at least once in the treatment to which they were referred. Since CRPs are residential stays, \"Linkage\" has been defined as when the client is admitted to the service\n\n Closed Loop Referral \n Referring and receiving providers are able to track the status of a referral and confirm client status between both providers\n\n Pods \n Group of bedrooms that share the same bathroom and can only be used for a single gender (adult) or sex assigned at birth (children). Almost all bedrooms at CRPs are dual occupancy, so in some cases a pod will only be for one room (or two beds), in other cases a pod will be for multiple bedrooms. These pods can be flipped from being a female room to a male room based on need\n\n Problem statement\n The focus of this initiative is aimed at CRP Supervisors, Clinicians, and associated management users, targeting several key challenges they currently encounter:\n CRPs in Orange County struggle with the manual and time-consuming task of answering numerous phone calls from CSUs, CAT, law enforcement, hospitals, etc. checking for available beds. This process wastes staff time, risks miscommunication, and delays placements. To streamline this, a solution is needed to display real-time bed availability for CRPs, enabling quicker and more informed decisions for referral\n\n The current referral process lacks a streamlined and efficient system for sending and receiving referrals across different OC programs. This results in communication gaps and delays in placing individuals in suitable CRPs\n\n There is a lack of visibility regarding bed availability across the 8 OC CRPs, leading to a lack of visibility from leadership and also on care coordination between CRPs. For example, referrals could be sent to multiple CRPs leading to duplicative work and confusion\n\n Overall, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive referral management system that enables OC CRPs to efficiently process incoming referrals, monitor outgoing referrals, and gain insights into bed availability. This system should bridge the communication gaps, provide the necessary flexibility for different program types, and offer a unified platform to enhance the referral coordination process among OC CRPs.\n Objective\n Create a system that allows OC CRPs to receive, manage, and send referrals to other OC programs (both county contracted and county operated). This includes the ability to: \n Receive and manage incoming referrals\n\n Send and track outgoing referrals\n\n View bed availability across the 8 OC CRPs:\n Adult CRPs: Coastal Star, Treehouse North [Silver], Treehouse South, Exodus\n Adult CRPs should be able to see bed availability cards for Adult and TAY \n\n TAY CRPs: Waymakers TAY\n TAY CRPs should be able to see bed availability cards for all CRPs\n\n Childrens CRPs: Waymakers Tustin, Waymakers Huntington Beach, Waymakers Laguna Beach\n Childrens CRPs should be able to bed availability cards for Children CRPs and TAY \n\n Broader Context\n CRPs will be the first program to include the Referrals & Linkages (R&L) module (a module designed to send and receive referrals digitally across the county)\n At first, since they will be the only program, they will only be able to document the referrals they send and receive\n\n However as additional programs are onboarded onto the R&L module, CRPs will be able to digitally send and receive referrals through Chorus \n\n Sharon would like the initial focus of R&L to be on the crisis system of care which includes: \n CRPs (new system) - 1st R&L program \n\n CSUs - 2nd R&L program (already built, but will need to be updated to be consistent with the CRP experience including adding the R&L module)\n\n CAT - 3rd R&L program (already built, but need to add R&L module)\n\n OC Links - 4th R&L program (already built, but need to add R&L module)\n\n IHCS (new system) (Dec 2024 update, IHCS has not been added) \n\n O&E (new mobile dispatch system) - Led in a separate initiative by JJ that will include the R&L module to reduce any retrofits down the road\n\n Personas\n CRP Supervisor (Maria) \n Goals: Maria wants to be able to care for her client and quickly view and manage all the referrals\n\n Motivations: Maria really cares about her clients and wants to make sure that they're efficiently and effectively admitted into her CRP\n\n Frustrations: Maria is frustrated that staff at CRPs spend so much time manually updating others on bed availability and entering in referral info. She also finds it difficult to report out to the county on referrals and linkages\n\n Clinician at TREEHouse North CRP (Leon) \n Goals: Leon wants to be able to care for his client and help clients find ongoing care after their stay at TREEHouse North CRP\n\n Motivations: Leon really wants to set up a care path for his clients so they can continue their treatment after they leave\n\n Frustrations: Leon is frustrated when he spends so much time on administrative tasks and can't quickly find information that could help his client\n\n Client at TREEHouse North CRP - note: clients will not have access to the CRP Bed board in the short term (Richard) \n Goals: Richard wants to work on his mental health by staying at TREEHouse North\n\n Motivations: Richard wants to get help with his anxiety and be able to have a plan of action after his stay at TREEHouse North\n\n Frustrations: Richard is frustrated by having to retell his story to different programs in the county. He's also frustrated that the process takes such a long time\n\n User Research Synthesis\n In person shadowing\n\n Ongoing design reviews and program check-ins\n\n Shadowing Docs\n CRPs \n\n User Journey for CRPs \n\n CSUs \n\n Notable quotes:\n \"The biggest pain-point is starting an intake process for a patient, and finding out that another facility admitted them.

Target Date: Q2 2025\n\n Integrated referrals and bedboards viewable directly on OC links, O&E, and CAT\n Requries bed availability to be moved to the OC Data Nexus.

The document below is tailored to the OC Warmline use case and how it fits into the larger project of building an improved case creation workflow.\n 11/7 update : We are exploring a different approach for this integration (i.e. NICE screen pop versus API) and will continue updating this document as needed.\n 1 6 false list false Chorus team \n PM: Mayra\n\n Project Manager: Mike V.\n\n Design: Ellie\n\n SAs: Christy Lee (lead), Eric, Gio, \n\n QA: Jason, Kayla\n\n Timeline \n Note: As of 11/7, all dates are tentative as we are assessing approach and next steps (API versus screen pop) \n SA build \n v1 handoff to client: 12/18 ( see OC forecast dates )\n\n Engineering \n Build \n Begins: 10/23 \n\n Ends (TBD) 12/14 \n\n E2E \n Begins: 12/18\n\n Ends: 12/28\n\n UAT begins: \n Begins: 01/02\n\n Ends: 01/12\n\n Training \n Begins: 01/15\n\n Ends: 01/25\n\n Jira Product Discovery \n OC Project > Warmline \n\n Figma file \n RC designs \n\n Client impacts & metrics \n OC Warmline\n Total staff: Scaling up to 150, starting on July 1, 2023 \n Staff per shift: 22; 15 taking calls \n Call volume: 10k/mo\n\n Client deadline \n Q1 2024\n\n Problem statement\n The focus of this initiative is targeted at OC Warmline staff, which includes administrators, supervisors, mentors, and volunteers. Currently, the staff use two disparate systems (see current state workflow below) to handle repetitive tasks when consumers aka \"participants\" are calling in for assistance. \n Before starting a new case, the dedicated Warmline team goes through the tedious process of manually transferring phone numbers from their RingCentral/NICE phone service to a case management system ( currently iCarol - which will be replaced by Chorus' proprietary web app ). This step is crucial for connecting these numbers to valued participant profiles or determining if new profiles should be created. Unfortunately, this process causes frustration for the hardworking Warmline staff, and it diverges from their ideal case workflow. We are committed to enhancing our support system to make this experience smoother and more aligned with our team's preferences.\n Goal \n Eliminate manual step(s) to transfer participant phone numbers from RingCentral/ NICE contact center into the new OC Warmline chorus application. \n\n Increase customer satisfaction (both Warmline user as well as participant experience) by reducing the amount of time needed to attend to the participant and create a new case.\n\n User Personas \n Lisa: Administrative Supervisor \n Goals : Lisa aims to streamline operations and optimize the efficiency of OC Warmline staff, ensuring quicker identification of callers within Chorus, thereby enabling faster delivery of emotional support services.\n\n Motivations : Lisa is driven by her commitment to empowering her team's performance and accelerating the provision of timely assistance to OC residents. She also seeks the capability to quantifiably measure achievements and provide comprehensive reports to stakeholders in the County.\n\n Frustrations : Lisa is notably frustrated by the existing manual processes between RingCentral and the case management system. This bottleneck hampers her staff's ability to promptly access participant profiles, including critical case history and referral details, hindering the amount of time staff spend providing emotional support.\n\n Andy: Warmline Mentor \n Goals : Andy is dedicated to offering immediate and meaningful assistance to participants reaching out to the Warmline during his shifts.\n\n Motivations : Driven by genuine compassion for making a difference, Andy recognizes the significant role he and his colleagues play in providing essential emotional support to Warmline participants. He embraces the responsibility of being a dependable listener, particularly for those who lack other avenues for communication.\n\n Frustrations : Andy is notably disheartened by the current process of having to navigate between two separate platforms to access phone numbers and participant information. He believes this valuable time could be better spent directly aiding individuals in need, aligning with the Warmline's core mission.\n\n Proposed Solution (See future state flow below) \n Integrate the new Chorus OC Warmline case management system with RingCentral/NICE contact center phone provider to: \n Allow staff to view the inbound phone number (auto-populated) without having to manually copy and paste from a different system; \n\n Automatically lookup/load participant information if already exists in the case management DB; \n\n If the phone number does not match an existing profile, allow staff to create a new participant profile.\n\n Critical User Journey\n User: Warmline staff \n Current state \n Future state \n Assumptions\n Warmline staff will start in a net new case management system within Chorus creating new case records going forward. \n\n Warmline will continue to have access to participant case history in iCarol. \n\n Key User Stories and Project Updates\n 7/18 updates: \n Tested with RC now that Chorus staff have Azure accounts. The test mostly passed, but when the phone passes, the search isn't being automatically triggered. \n\n Recent change was that RC introduced country code to match updated Chorus requirements. and Jamie will work with SAs to investigate. \n\n 3/27 updates: \n Sanjiv looking into the issue will be joining the 3/28 weekly check-in with the client and Jenny to test again\n\n 3/20 updates: \n Tested the 3/23 Eng fix CHORUS-6127 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira with a Warmline staff ( ticket here ) and included the RingCentral vendor and primary stakeholder during the call as well, and unfortunately, the issue was not resolved. The user was still routed to the dashboard.\n Next steps \n Mike and Mayra and to gather with Sanjiv to possibly do some more testing/info gathering.\n\n Mike and Mayra and to work with Sanjiv to outline next steps and a possible timeline to complete additional troubleshooting/testing. Might also need OC IT for any Azure/SSO dependencies. The vendor would really like us to provide a general timeframe and we stressed we can't know until we investigate the root cause.\n\n Mayra to update emails going out next week so that staff are aware that RC will not be included as part of the April 1 launch; we have been communicating that outstanding issues were being tested this week and we'd know if it could be included in the launch. \n\n Mayra to update training deck/documentation to include same messaging that will be added to the comms. \n\n 3/1 updates: \n Staff testing complete. Summary, results, and next steps in Figjam .\n\n Outstanding issue: IM-250 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n Engineering to include as part of 3/20 release\n\n If issue is not resolved, we will NOT include the basic RC integration when we launch on April 1 \n\n 2/29 updates: \n Testing with staff scheduled for 2/30\n View instructions \n\n Raghu, RC tech lead, still doesn't have access; will join testing and observe/document any issues to troubleshoot on his end \n\n IM-236 is happening again and staff are prompted to log in to Azure; Mayra and Christy to meet \n\n 1/30 updates: \n IM-236 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira resolved \n\n Next steps: \n Raghu RingCentral's Chorus access removed; working with Lisbeth to grant access again so he can validate that he is no longer required to log in a second time \n\n Asking RC to grant Warmline staff access to RC/Nice test account so they can test with OC IT's SSO and multi-factor setup; Lisbeth to share who she would like to participate in testing \n Test steps here \n\n 1/16 updates: \n Engineering will assess IM-236 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira this week and will have a better sense of LOE by EOD 1/18. \n\n 1/9 updates: \n Jan 9 check-in/testing with RC team \n Outstanding issue: Users are prompted to log in to Chorus once the Chorus tab launches, even though they're already logged in. Will escalate to Engineering. \n\n 1/2 updates: \n See Ring Central/NICE testing notes and steps \n Action items: Mayra provided w/test account; Raghu is preparing test script to make test calls and will send when ready. \n\n 11/30 updates: FYI\n RingCentral is in the midst of UAT for the call center which will be going live on 12/05 . Below are some notes that pertain to our team:\n Raghu shared that when he uses the screen pop, it forces him to log back into the system. Once he logs back in, it brings him to the create a case page.\n Follow-up notes: \n Asked Raghu to send screen share of what he's seeing so we can validate issue.\n\n Possible workarounds to discuss internally to prevent staff from having to log in when closing browser window (Note: Warmline has shared that all staff use Chrome on PCs; Chrome seems to delete session cookie, but Safari does not):\n Train staff to keep browser window open when taking calls from RC/NICE and creating cases in Chorus. \n\n Discuss with Eng if there is an option to set longer term session with an expiry code encoded, for the Warmline only. However, this may lead to other issues if staff do want the browser to log them out upon closing. \n\n Research other options.\n Server-side session management to extend session durations; keep-alive mechanisms; user activity tracking; persistent cookies; custom session handling; adjust client-side settings; implement idle timeout\n For all of these, consider security implications as longer durations might increase risk of unauthorized access if session is hijacked\n\n He also mentioned that he will need a participant profile phone number that exists in the Warmline system that he can use for testing too.\n Follow up notes: Shared test account with Raghu 123-456-7890 \n\n Prem shared that they'll be able to work more with us after the call center and holidays . He spoke with Stephanie about this a week ago or so too.\n\n 11/28 updates: \n Raghu is passing the phone to the URLs and will keep us posted on testing\n\n 11/27 updates: \n 2 URLs ready for RC/NICE to test screen pop (see user story #1)\n\n Mayra created Raghu's Warmline account and emailed team that his access and URLs are ready for testing\n Raghu confirmed account set up \n\n 11/9 updates: \n Will ask RC/NICE to send phone numbers in the following format: XXXXXXXXXX\n 11/14 response from RC/NICE: Yes, we can send the below format from CXONE to Chorus. Format: XXXXXXXXXX \n\n We can programmatically enter the + in the URL\n\n We can reformat the text fields to phone once Eng addresses the following issue (tentatively week of 11/29): CHORUS-5849 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n Priority \n User story \n\n 1\n CP-5259 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n 11/27 updates: \n URLs ready for RC testing:\n Existing profile with phone number: https://chorusplatform.io/m/oc-warmline/rc?phone=234567890 \n\n Phone number not in the system: https://chorusplatform.io/m/oc-warmline/rc?phone=234567777 \n\n 2\n CP-3909 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n TBD if needed\n DES-675 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n 3\n CP-3910 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n N/A\n CP-3911 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira Not needed for launch, per client as it would be redundant from what RC will provide (let's keep it here for reference) \n\n Success metrics\n Goal \n Metric \n\n Improve case workflow by removing burden of having to copy and paste phone number from RingCentral into Chorus to view participant profile and case history. \n Gather staff feedback and assess satisfaction with integration. \n Did we help reduce inefficiencies? \n\n Milestones \n Milestone 1: Integration Discovery\n Milestone 2: Design\n Milestone 3: Development\n Milestone 4: Testing\n Milestone 5: UAT\n Milestone 6: Release\n\n Release Blockers: \n If there are any security, integration, or compliance issues. \n\n Release Blockers: \n If the design leads to a user experience that is hard to navigate.\n\n Release Blockers: \n API issues or various other integration/compatibility issues with Chorus.\n\n Release Blockers: \n Identification of issues that compromise security, functionality, or performance of the integration. \n\n Release Blockers: \n Any user feedback from testing that identifies any bugs or critical issues.\n\n Release Blockers: \n Any issues that arose from internal testing or UAT that would compromise the functioning integration of RingCentral, operational workflows of the Warmline staff, and synchronization of data. \n\n Must have: \n A basic understanding of the technical needs for data sharing and APIs between Chorus and RingCentral. \n\n Understanding of the design requirements needed for RingCentral to integrated into the Chorus platform. \n\n Must have: \n The RingCentral integration design should be easy to navigate. \n\n Design should include showing participant information displays (includes demographic) \n\n Design should include showing who the participant has talked to today \n\n Design should include showing how many times the participant has called today/how recently \n\n Must have: \n Functioning integration of RingCentral (NICE inContact) with the Chorus platform. \n\n Associate calls/phone numbers with new and existing cases in the Warmline system.\n\n Synchronization of staff and contractor RingCentral accounts and Chorus accounts. \n\n Displays participant information displays (includes demographic) \n\n Displays who the participant has talked to today \n\n Displays how many times the participant has called today/how recently\n\n Must have: \n Verification that the interface operates smoothly and that calls are being logged and matched to profiles correctly.\n\n Verification that the following information is displayed: \n Participant information displays (includes demographic) \n\n Who the participant has talked to today \n\n How many times the participant has called today/how recently\n\n Must have: \n Positive feedback on the design and build of the RingCentral integration. Would like to see if this enhances their workflow and daily operations as intended. \n\n Must have: \n Successful release of the integration that results in a smooth user platform, accurate call logging and overall functionality of the platform for the Warmline staff. \n\n Nice to have: \n Nice to have: \n Design of any additional features outside of basic integration.\n\n Nice to have: \n Nice to have: \n Nice to have: \n Positive user feedback on all test plans.\n\n Nice to have: \n\n Future phases\n Out of scope\n Staff pick up the call via a RingCentral widget that pops up in Chorus (in-app dial screen).\n If staff set themselves to available, the widget is automatically opens on their screen. \n\n If staff do not set themselves to take calls or work on follow ups (not available), then they open the widget and dial out. \n\n Data dashboards for any metrics. Chorus will provide raw data to the Warmline/County. \n\n RingCentral metrics/dashboards within Chorus. \n\n Files or references\n See RingCentral (Nice in Contact) + Chorus API Integration PRD for technical information. \n Problems to solve\n Schedule technical discussion once contract is finalized between OC Warmline and RingCentral. The Warmline staff will facilitate in scheduling this discussion. \n\n Decisions\n 11/2 - Let's pursue the NICE screen pop approach versus the NICE API as this will lead to a better user experience by sending data faster to Chorus; API might lead to delays, which will cause user frustration when trying to create cases quickly. \n See meeting notes from design review and discussion . \n\n Open questions \n Question \n Answer \n Team to ask \n\n See RingCentral (Nice in Contact) + Chorus API Integration PRD for additional technical questions.\n\n Do phone calls ever get transferred?\n Yes, phone calls can get transferred to supervisors if a participant is abusive or inappropriate with the staff.\n\n Which platform will be responsible for reporting answered and unanswered calls?\n RingCentral will be responsible for this.\n\n We need to be able to be able to display more than one phone number for each participant; right now, we only have one phone field per participant. \n Status: Created new corresponding story. \n\n We are having discussions with the Warmline about removing the Caller section and fields as it's not as common for someone else to call on the behalf of a participant. \n The Warmline confirmed that this does not happen very often. The decision is to have the field be optional for them to fill out.\n\n 11/2 - Any concerns with integrating via the NICE screen pop approach ( PopURL )? Let's discuss with RingCentral on 11/7 with Preston joining the Warmline/RC implementation call. \n 11/7 notes and action items: \n No, let's proceed and complete the following:\n Send RC/NICE @Raghu M URL \n Once we've done the configuration on our side with our SAs to place the URL in the browser, send them the URL to test\n\n Create test account for @Raghu M \n\n Coordinate with Lisbeth to walk us through the current RC/NICE setup/build since they're already in UAT. \n\n Work with SAs to get this in before Warmline begins to UAT what we've built. \n Mayra and Katy will discuss tasks/next steps on 11/7 at 4:30\n Created new ticket for SAs to set up; shared with Christy Forte and Christy Lee; meeting on 11/8 to discuss questions and whether we can add to sprint 10 (in progress)\n\n Only issue might be if we do want to provide call history log in Chorus; let's review the RC/Nice integration and gather any additional requirements. In the past, Warmline expressed that a call log/history in Chorus would be duplicative of a call log in RingCentral/NICE.\n\n 11/2 - How does Warmline handle chats? Is an agent handling chats and calls at the same time? \n 11/7 notes and action items:\n Participant chats are handled in iCarol, using a Warmline local number. \n Internal staff chats are handled in RingCentral.\n Are the peer support specialists taking chats and calls? \n Shift supervisors and peer support specialists are taking:\n One call at time\n\n One chat at a time \n\n In RC, peer support specialists set themselves to \"do not disturb\" when taking chats \n In the future, explore automatically setting \"do not disturb\" once staff claim a chat in Chorus and then setting back to available after the chat has been closed\n\n Once we are ready to port over the participant chat phone to Chorus, let's keep in mind that Twilio might take weeks to do this. \n\n 11/2 - What happens if staff are logged in to NICE but are not logged in to Chorus? Let's think through this workflow.\n\n 11/2 - What happens if they close the browser? How do they recover? \n In NICE would they reopen the screen pop?\n\n We could associate the call ID/event with the logs \n\n Might be just an edge case but we can explore"

Location TBD\n\n Questions\n Understand their workflows, focusing on: \n How they are using our tool?\n\n Areas of opportunity (e.g., workarounds, going between pages, taking notes on the side)?\n What do you dislike?\n\n Areas that are helpful?\n What do you like?\n\n What should we prioritize improving?\n\n Where/when on the app (both CAT and OC Links) are you seeing missing data?\n\n Where/when do you see data crossing?\n\n Where/when do you see notification issues?\n\n How is new Clinician onboarding onto Chorus?\n\n Time permitting: \n How do you send referrals?\n What information do you send?\n\n Do you receive confirmation that a referral has been accepted? Linked?\n\n What other systems are you currently entering client data into?\n Where is the information you're entering duplicative?\n\n Helpful Tips While Shadowing\n Meet with a supervisor or manager, etc as a team first when you arrive\n Introduce yourselves\n\n Reiterate expectations (how long you'll be there, what you're looking for, etc)\n\n Get tips on how to participate w/o getting in the way\n\n Divide and conquer so we can get more data back. I'd have each of you shadow individually, and try to shadow as many as you can. An ideal data set would be 5+ people. If we can shadow 5+ people and observe 10-20 use cases, that would be amazing (not sure how long a 'case' will last, but you get the idea: more is better).\n Due to safety and the nature of the situation, we will not be dividing and conquering and will likely only be shadowing one person \n\n Ask the person you're shadowing to think out loud (when appropriate) to talk through what they're feeling, what they need, what they dislike, what they like. (as long as it doesn't interfere or diminish the experience/task they're working on). If it's not appropriate to verbalize thinking while with a client, quickly chat for a few mins between client interactions to capture what they were thinking\n\n Note: Where it is appropriate and not disruptive, ask questions to staff about their workflow and experience using Chorus\n\n Notes\n Shadow Person 1\n Client 1\n\n Client 2\n\n Client 3\n\n Findings\n Notes from Mike Squibb: \n If possible, get together right after the research ends and discuss high level findings while it's all fresh in your mind.\n\n Synthesize findings asap after (the next day, for example) so you can create a user journey (or journeys) and plot out where there's friction, needs, pain points, wins, etc."

    "content": "📇 Contents\n 6 1 false Summary|Contents|Quick reference list false Quick reference\n Chorus team \n PM: Julie J. 🤓\n PjM: Sarah 👑\n SA: Christy L., Donovan, Christina 💪\n Design: Ellie 🎨\n QA: TBD\n\n Customer impacts \n O&E Admins\n\n O&E Field Workers\n\n Customer deadline \n December 2023\n\n Problem\n Lack of Integration and Efficiency in Referrals and Dispatch \nThe current system for managing referrals and dispatches in O&E is fragmented, with limited integration among various providers and programs. This results in delays, missed information, and inconsistencies in care coordination, making it difficult for administrators to ensure that participants receive timely and appropriate care.\n\n Limited Tools for Field Workers and Real-Time Case Management \nO&E outreach workers currently rely on paper notes and limited mobile access, which hinders their ability to manage cases in real time. Without mobile tools, workers risk losing critical information and struggle to keep up with case updates, impacting both their effectiveness and the quality of care provided to participants. \n\n Challenges with Tracking Client Outcomes and Care Progress \nThe existing workflow for documenting participant interactions, outcomes, and care progress is inefficient and lacks transparency. Administrators face difficulty tracking field workers' activities, monitoring case statuses, and ensuring follow-ups. This lack of visibility makes it challenging to maintain consistent quality and support across various service areas, often resulting in gaps in client care and missed opportunities for timely interventions.\n\n Difficulty in Accessing Comprehensive Participant Information \nO&E administrators and outreach workers have limited access to participants' complete profiles and histories across the different programs they interact with, leading to duplicated data entry and potentially incomplete records. This limitation makes it harder to coordinate whole-person care, as workers need to repeatedly ask participants for the same information and face challenges when connecting participants to multiple resources.\n\n Need for Data-Driven Insights and Quality Improvements \nThe current system lacks advanced data tracking and analytics capabilities, making it difficult for O&E to assess program effectiveness and drive improvements. The inability to collect and analyze data across all phases of a participant's journey—from referral to service outcomes—restricts the program's ability to make informed decisions for quality improvement and population health management.\n\n 🗣️ Terminology\n You know what would be helpful when reading this doc? To know what all the words mean.\n Term/Abbreviation \n Explanation \n\n O&E (Outreach & Engagement) \n From OC HCA : The Orange County Outreach & Engagement (OC O&E) program serves individuals experiencing unsheltered homelessness in Orange County. The program's services focus on linking individuals to needed housing, physical health, behavioral health, and other supportive services by addressing their barriers to care. This is accomplished through developing and building trusting relationships with the homeless community and collaborating with other service providers. Our multi-disciplinary team is proud to provide compassionate, client-centered, and consistent care to meet the needs of the most underserved people in our community. \n\n Participant \n It's important to note that the O&E program refers to people receiving care as \"participant,\" not \"client\" as with other programs.\n\n Administrator \n Sometimes referred to as \"Officer of the Day\" (OD) or \"Regional Supervisor.\" Whatever the name, these are the folks that are managing cases and workers from an office.\n\n Outreach worker \n Sometimes referred to as \"field worker,\" and in other programs, often referred to as \"clinicians.\" These folks are licensed clinical social workers who are out in the community and providing aid to participants.\n\n Referral \n When a participant is given a recommendation in writing from another program to receive aid from O&E.\n\n SPA \n Acronym for \"Service Provider Area,\" which divides the county into 3 manageable sections:\n North\n\n Central \n\n South\n\n Objective\n Create a system for O&E to receive, send, and manage referrals, track and manage dispatches, and create a mobile solution for outreach workers in the field. \n 🌎 Broader Context\n Our goal is to better integrate O&E with OC Links, CAT and Referrals & Linkages . This expansion will create a unified experience between Chorus apps being used by OC HCA.\n Key components of this system are: \n Desktop Administrator Functionalities\n Incoming Referrals Dashboard\n\n Manage Referral page\n\n Outgoing Referrals Dashboard\n\n Dispatch Dashboard\n\n Mobile Outreach Worker Functionalities\n SMS & Email Notifications\n\n Assigned Cases Dashboard\n\n Details tab\n\n My cases\n\n My Progress tab\n\n Activity tab\n\n Outcomes tab\n Access to OC Nav resources\n\n Create a new case* \n *Future State – currently out of scope \n\n User Research Synthesis\n In person shadowing\n 2 outreach worker ridealongs\n\n 1 triage counselor shadowing\n\n Ongoing design reviews and program check-ins\n\n See all research findings here: O&E Shadowing (Dispatch Team & Field Clinicians) \n 🧍Personas\n Armin, O&E Administrator \n Goals: He wants to be able to keep track of incoming referrals and see which outreach workers are dispatched onto what cases, and track cases and staff as they progress.\n\n Motivations: He wants to make sure that participants that need help are receiving timely care. He also wants to make sure that staff are safe and able to work with the participants.\n\n Frustrations: He's frustrated that he has no way to track staff's progress in the field and has limited information about the participant and the cases attached to them.\n\n Tammy, O&E Outreach Worker \n Goals: She wants to be notified when a new case is assigned to her, no matter where she is in the county. She wants to be able to keep track of all the cases that are assigned to her and record outcomes in an app while out in the field.\n\n Motivations: She wants to be able to administer care to participants effectively and make sure no people in need are falling through the cracks because of disorganization.\n\n Frustrations: She is frustrated because she has to manage cases by taking notes on a piece of paper while she's out in the field. Sometimes she forgets to track something about a client because she has a lot going on at once.\n\n 🔀 Functional Workflow: Future State\n https://www.figma.com/file/ttLVUasjMzHujLXXAvPSf5/O%26E-Functional-Workflow?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=B6AVO9jcLUfbwpj8-1 \n Success Metrics \n Goal \n Metric \n\n Ensure timely response to triage requests and services for clients\n Time from referral request to starting interaction with client (linkage)\n\n Rate of triage requests that result in linkage\n\n Rate of closed triage requests\n\n Reduce admin burden related to double data entry \n Reduced number of paper-based referrals\n\n Decreased data entry required in HMIS\n\n Future Roadmap\n Integrate UAF experience into mobile referrals & dispatch workflow\n Sending referrals for clients encountered via UAF\n\n Dropping pins in dispatches\n\n Update client profile experience\n Comprehensive history of dispatches & UAF encounters\n\n Add Geotab support for county vehicles\n\n Requirements \n See epics and related stories for most up-to-date details.\n Epics \n\n CP-3307 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n CP-3309 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n CP-4404 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n CP-3315 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n CP-3320 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n CP-4535 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System Jira \n\n Program Specific Questions \n See the Referral Information Form confluence page for all program specific questions.\n Incoming Referral Dashboard \n\n User Story : As an O&E Admin, I want the ability to manage incoming referrals so that I can make sure cases are being accepted and assigned appropriately.\n Requirements :\n View all incoming referrals and filter by:\n Participant, SPA, City, Referral Date, Status, Worker , Supervisor\n When users filter by \"worker,\" it should display them regardless of which role they're assigned on the case (primary field worker, field worker #2, field worker #3, etc.) \n\n The referrals should default sort from newest to oldest referrals\n However, Admins want the ability to sort by oldest to newest as well\n\n Manage Referral Page \n User Story : As an O&E Admin, I want the ability to view the details of the referral so that I can gain information about the participant, their location, and their needs before dispatching a worker.\n\n Requirements : \n Page will include:\n Referral information and client information \n There should be two edit buttons - one to edit the referral info and one to edit client info\n Note that multiple referrals might apply to one client, so if client info is edited, it will be reflected in all cases/referrals attached to that client.

    "content": "https://geotab.github.io/sdk/ : SDK Resource \n Follow Up: Geotab & Chorus (Associating Individuals with Vehicles) \n\n 11:00am\n Attendees : \n Chorus: Carter, Katy Jeter, Shane, Sarah\n Geotab: Drake Zwahlen\n Options for Associating Individuals with Vehicles: \n Geotab Drive: \n Can a user sign into Geotab drive, while in their personal vehicle rather than a fleet vehicle? \n Geotab drive can only be used to indicate the location and status of a single driver utilizing a vehicle installed with Geotab hardware , it can not account for personal vehicles or passengers riding in such vehicles. Geotab Drive is used for logging things like Pre/Post Trip outcomes, tracking when a driver has entered into the vehicle and when they exit, etc. There is no additional cost to use Geotab drive. \n\n Is there a way to turn off the Geotab data that records the trip?\n Yes, but this would have to be done by department if they don't want GPS, activated \n\n Can you have multiple people associated with a single vehicle?\n Only one person should be assigned to a vehicle based on \"who's hand is on the steering wheel\". The data that Geotab tab collects is in relation to the driver not the passenger \n\n If needed Drake shared that he could further investigate the option for customizing Geotab drive to add an additional person as a new field \n If we considered this option, Chorus would need to verify if our API can pull and read into our system \n\n Limitation:\n Geotab drive doesn't require the user to engage with sign on, there is no enforcement. People may forget to sign into the app to indicate that they are driving a specified vehicle that day \n\n Key Fob \n Can you share more about how these work? Strengths/limitations? \n They're call NFC Readers and they cost 65$ per reader plus installation. The reader is more expensive but the additional \"card\" is about 2$ per card if the program wanted to buy back ups. \n\n If a user forgets to activate the NFC reader, an audible alert will go off until the driver signs in. It increases likelihood of driver engaging and logging the datapoint \n\n The key fob can only indicate one driver at a time . If two individuals both had key fobs, and both scanned the NFC reader, the person who was last to scan, would be the person who Geotab will have indicated as the driver of the car. \n\n General Questions: \n How does Geotab account for low reception coverage data? What happens to the data stream while out of service? \n If driver goes into low coverage area, Geotab stores data at the last registered location before coverage was lost and will keep that location as the vehicle location until service is found again. \n\n Discovery: CAT & Chorus (Pain Points and Goals) \n\n 9:00am\n Attendees : \n Chorus: \n Sarah, Carter, Shane, JJ, Phoenix\n OC:\n Amy Couch \n Erika Punchard\n Ryan Yowell\n Matthew Kee\n Vanessa Thomas\n Questions: \n Do all CAT staff use the same vehicle each time or does this change? \n If it changes, what is the frequency? \n\n Is there a grouping of existing fleet vehicles associated with CAT? \n\n Right now there are 5 CAT county fleet vehicles\\\n\n If responding in pairs and there are 21 vehicles in the future, not everyone will be able to have a utilize a CAT vehicle\n\n Timeline for when all 21 vehicles will be up and running \n May 2024\n\n The fleet vehicles will be retrofitted with a double cell in the back of the car similar to law enforcement barriers \n\n Deliver date for vehicles could be spring 2024\n maybe later than May \n\n Clinician teams will be going out in pairs\n This pilot has already started\n\n Full staffing of teams is not complete; program is currently hiring more staff\n\n Currently all staff are able to use all fleet vehicles one staff is not associated with each fleet vehicles \n How are we going to match clinicians to the vehicles \n\n Two vehicles are ADA vans, if need to assign one for the whole day, they can, but need it flexible \n e.g. could select the vehicle they're assigned to in the moment when they accept a dispatch \n\n CAT is still fleshing out how they will assign staff to each vehicle \n\n Are there certain limitations of fleet vehicle information that can be captured and shared considering privacy and union regulations?\n Can track the car but not the staff \n\n Could be voluntary that they sign on virutally for the day \n\n For dispatching need to know where the cars are \n\n For safety would be nice to know who was in which car \n\n Nothing wrong knowing where the staff is, \n\n Clinicians are already being track for which cars they're using\n they're already using this\n\n All clinicians are using county phones that could be tracked \n\n How are we going to track car and how are going to associate the clinician with the car \n CAT is tracking the cars, but if there's another section of the platfrom to see who is assigned to the vehicles then we can coordinate dispatch \n\n Pairs \n Will they be the same pair for the whole day?\n Still being decided, but ideally the pair will be for the whole day, but may need the ability to edit and change pairs \n one may go home sick or have expertise that needs to be assigned \n\n Do CAT vehicles already have Geotab installed? If not, is there an estimated timeline when the hardware will be installed? \n The vehicles will have Geotab installed in May\n\n Police officers use their computers as GPS system, if teams are using their own cars, and computers use GPS locators, could we create a system where everyone is able to be track and integrate Geotab Drive with the app feature \n would prefer for all staff to be able to transport \n\n Notes : \n Pain Point is CAT program's lack of expertise in the area and figuring out what is going to work best for program\n\n Toured Sherif dispatch center and learned how they track and monitor their units\n\n Hopes/dreams are to be able to see where staff are, have it integrate into chorus dispatch process that is currently being utilized \n\n They want to know where vehicles are in real time\n\n How to ensure safety of staff\n e.g.they accept a call but the car hasn't moved they can follow up\n\n Know where everyone i so they have more realtime or mapping information \n\n Must ensure response times are 60 minutes across the board from the time the need is identified to when they arrive on the seen\n 60 min from when call comes in from the arrival of the staff\n the way it's currently being tracked is tricky\n\n making MHSA goals o 75% are 30 min or less \n\n The data requirements \n when the need is identified \n is the start of the timer\n\n The moment a clinician leave the location they're at is the start of the clock \n\n When the call comes in and the call determines that a CAT need is necessary then the clock starts for connection \n Part missing:\n The initial time that the call comes in\n\n The new benefit: \n still trying to determine when the clinician has accepted this \n\n eg. Client calls OC Links, then OC Links connects to CAT, but how is that captured? \n want to capture the moment that CAT dispatch leaves \n\n Metrics should be with OC links send the dispatch to CAT \n Has to be when the dispatch questions are asked \n\n It depends on the type of call, some can be determined early on that it would be a CAT call vs others will take more time\n\n Needs to be individualized so it's not one size fits all\n\n Idea that theres a button pressed to generate the \"clock\" to start\n the button could be a priority call generated dispatch now \n\n Won't dispatch until they have the information, but the state doesn't care they just care that once the call comes in and it's been determined that the crisis is needed then the clock starts regardless of coordinating details \n\n MHSA reform dependent (going to ballet next year) \n\n 60 minute Dispatch planning\n The clock starts when need is identified\n\n Idea that a caller in could click a button that starts a timer AFTER the need is identified \n\n Then dispatcher could continue their collection of additional information \n for some calls an OC links operator might know earlier in the call rather than later \n\n OC Links dispatcher dispatch staff to the field \n\n Currently looking to build the scheduler into Chorus \n for children's it goes to the officer of the day and then the OD dispatches \n\n when they end up in the list then they dispatch to the location \n\n Dispatch decision tree\n when they get to dispatch &rarr; Yes, then that could be when the caller clicks the button\n\n Discovery: Geotab & Chorus Technical Feasibility \n\n 3:00 pm\n Attendees: \n Chorus : \n Carter, Shane, JJ, Sarah\n Geotab: \n Drake Zwahlen: BD with Geotab; runs the west region for public sector \n Brianne Biczo: Public Sector Account advisor, handles west coast public sector accounts\n Agenda : \n PDs ask their prepared questions to understand feasibility \n Prepared Questions and Meeting Answers: \n Can Geotab manage logic for closet clinician in the field to closest client referral \n Geotab can work with Refuge for high density routing\n Geotab isn't does not offer routing because they don't know the driver destination just the driver's current location and history of location\n\n Chorus would have to account for destination if they wanted to offer the ability for a user to factor in arrival time\n Geotab tracks things such as \n RPM of engine\n\n Vehicle speed\n\n If a driver is using their seat belt, etc.\n\n If it was a build requirement to provide arrival time within the chorus app, Chorus to calculate arrival time based speed limits in the area, Geotab data of vehicle location, and current speed \n\n Can Geotab send Chorus data in real time? \n Yes, it just depends on what Chorus & OC needs\n eg.g do the data pushes need to occur second by second vs instant call out \n\n Fleet management is not getting real time data, just assess health (oil changes, etc.)\n\n how is that data sent\n Access via myGeotab , get a dashboard of all the data\n\n at what frequency\n Chorus & OC can determine the frequency as needed \n\n Are there costs associated with access OC Fleet Geotab Data? If so, who pays this cost? \n No extra cost to access the Geotab data and Geotab is already tracking all OC Fleet Vehicles with the hardware installed \n\n Customer pays monthly to access their data \n Chorus will NOT need an extra license and there's no extra fee to access the data\n\n Chorus will just need OC permission to access MyGeotab online portal & data repository \n\n Can Geotab translate distance to time to arrival for dispatch \n No but they have the data needed to calculate it based on determined destination\n\n Are there any costs associated with regular API calls for all fleet vehicle data in real time? \n no extra cost for Chorus to collect that data because the county is already paying for this. \n\n Does Geotab have the ability to overlay vehicles on a map? \n Geotab pays a license for mapping so they can't sublet out to a developer\n\n Chorus would need to buy our own map and then use Geotab API to populate it, Chorus could use Geotab SDK and use the code on the script to plug into the map \n\n Additional Notes: \n Geotab can also track the location of a human outside the fleet vehicle if they have a key fob associated with them\n OC's not currently doing this\n if they want to track an individual, the clinician would need to swipe a key fob to track individual user to various car\n\n $65 per fob \n\n OC is paying for access to their fleet data via Geotab\n They have the ability to use Geotab SDK to populate their data into Chorus apps\n\n OC Fleet department is currently collecting fleet engine health specifics\n They've recently partnered with other social service programs to identify other programatic needs that could be supported by leveraging existing Geotab technology \n\n Geotab Questions to Chorus\n Need to know if the vehicle is always assigned to an individual, is it constant? \n\n It would make it easier to associate individual A to vehicle A\n\n It wouldn't be an expensive need to be able to differentiate user\n Could assign a set of vehicles all grouped into a Crisis Group and could assign the keys. In this grouping, the program you wouldn't need a key fob to account for each field clinician \n\n GeoFences \n Geotab has the ability to plot a field for areas that may be hazard zones or have a history of being unsafe \n supervisor can be alerted if a stop is taking too long for safety reasons or in an unsafe area\n\n Fleet \n OC is on the highest level plan and can use up as much data as they want\n\n They currently have access to more data than they need \n\n Right now the vehicles have second by second data being captured in real time for every asset \n Chorus would need access to the parent account for Human services, chorus could have real time data for every vehicle IF it's moving \n If it's not moving, the data available with be the most up to date data of when the vehicle was last used\n\n Associating Vehicles with users \n Could install Geotab drive on field clinician's work phones \n no additional cost for that \n\n Could also manually put in license plate number in Geotab drive\n\n Fail point is that it's devise dependent\n Easy for users to forget to check in \n\n CAT staff have work issued phone that they require to access CAT so they could use the Geotab drive option there too\n\n Integrations\n Geotab doesn't integrate, their partners integrate\n\n Geotab provides constant information that can be pulled from from partners \n\n Go to Geotab market place to see resources available\n\n Chorus could be in the Geotab market place if we were interested \n It's not vetted out 100%\n\n Chorus could be added to the market easily \n very channel friendly market \n\n Chorus advertise that we can partner with Geotab\n We can give Geotab a list of our clients and let them know that the integration is available \n\n Important to client\n Staff want to get credit for the work they do so need name associated with their case \n\n Implementation Timeline \n OC received the hardware last week to integrate (June 19th 2023) \n\n Implementation is for when the vehicles are scheduled to come to the shop for their scheduled maintenance\n that is when they will update vehicles as they roll out\n\n Fleet is willing to adjust timeline as needed based on program needs \n\n OC is monitoring 1400 of their fleet vehicles \n\n Meeting \n Attendees \n Notes \n\n Geotab & CAT Program Initial Meeting \n\n * This was an initial meeting with Geotab Reps, County Program Staff, County Fleet Staff and Chorus \n\n Chorus :\n Sarah Burdette\n\n Austin Heap\n\n Carter Moar\n\n Julie Jessup\n\n OC : \n Matthew Kee\n\n Linda Molina\n\n Erika Punchard\n\n Amy Couch \n\n Omar Leyva\n\n Geotab :\n Drake Z\n Brianne Biczo\n Geotab collects data on the asset targeted\n Vehicle health and utilization\n\n Helps agencies service their vehicles\n if something enters the area or a fueling event is needed\n\n If a driver is not wearing a seatbelt\n\n Backing into a parking spot vs driving directly in\n\n Largest service provider for tracking\n\n Contract with state and federal agencies\n\n Data\n meats all IT security requirements in CA\n\n OC data is owned by county \n\n Has a SDK (software development kit)\n can pull data into any system you want\n\n dependent on how it's hosted\n can use a script, make an API call, and then pull that data into chorus \n\n e.g. location data, mileage, etc. \n\n data is by vehicle\n not tracked by person, unless you assign a vehicle to a person\n\n OC Requests & Requirements \n OC wanted to set the meeting up to understand if Geotab would communicate with Chorus in terms with Geomapping for Crisis Assessment teams \n\n Want to improve dispatching efficiency because don't know where staff are\n they call in every two hours \n\n under fed requirement to improve response times \n\n Want to explore ways to better track vehicles to be able to dispatch vehicles and staff in a timely manner \n\n SDK database is flexible and can be created as needed\n\n Chorus could get APIs SDK, we can review the SDKs, and depending on log in needs, we can create rules on that\n You can coordinate skillset of staff needed and dispatch the grouping based on the fleet team\n the administrator would pull all the administrators, location data, and then be able to quickly asses and classify as needed\n\n Need to determine IF we can put location data into Chorus\n depending on the rulesets within Chorus, Chorus will review the SDK, see the API calls that we can pull from Geotab and align requirements with Geotab functionality \n\n E.g. Can go into Geotab and see where staff are on a map, collect data with rules behind it in chorus, can improve dispatch based on skillset and locatoin\n\n Goal: replace the need for staff to drop pins & have a map of where things are in real time \n can get access into myGeotab with real time tracking and it shows it on a map \n\n The frequency of Chorus visibility is dependent on the API call that is coordinated within Chorus \n\n Chorus Question to Geotab\n Does Geotab do imbedded Viz or imbedded maps?\n They may have imbedded maps, but Drake will have to follow up on this\n\n Carter will email Drake to clarify with imbedded tabs \n\n Geotab https://geotab.github.io/sdk/ \n\n Vehicles that are using it currently\n if vehicles have a unit number, they will have Geotab\n\n Law enforcement may have exemptions on the GPS program\n\n ANY county vehicle with a unit number & fleet services is maintaining them, then they will have GPS services installed (Geotab)\n Its coming pre-installed \n\n Need to know who will be the administrator for this work for HCA as a whole and then they can start breaking it down by department\n HCA wants to set up training for the agency department on how to utilize the Geotab service and resource\n\n Each HCA department may have their own use case and workflows \n\n Can HCA designate individuals as administrators to oversee programs under the agencies\n Covered by 1 agency admin\n set ups\n\n rights\n\n questions/admin support \n\n Next Steps\n What departments will Chorus be working with (O&E, CAT?)\n What are their requirements \n\n What problems are they trying to solve \n\n Chorus will review SDK and follow up with Drake for questions"

    "content": "Objectives\n Shadow administrators and clinicians while they intake referrals and clients and track progress through discharge\n\n Better understand how users are interacting with other systems to find areas of opportunity\n\n Learn how CRP employees receive and send referrals as we look to develop this capability in Chorus\n\n Important note: this research will only ever be used internally to guide product design only with this product team, we will never share data and will always keep data private\n\n Helpful Tips While Shadowing\n Meet with a supervisor or manager, etc as a team first when you arrive\n Introduce yourselves\n\n Reiterate expectations (how long you'll be there, what you're looking for, etc)\n\n Get tips on how to participate w/o getting in the way\n\n Divide and conquer so we can get more data back. I'd have each of you shadow individually, and try to shadow as many as you can. An ideal data set would be 5+ people. If we can shadow 5+ people and observe 10-20 use cases, that would be amazing (not sure how long a 'case' will last, but you get the idea: more is better).\n\n Ask the person you're shadowing to think out loud (when appropriate) to talk through what they're feeling, what they need, what they dislike, what they like. (as long as it doesn't interfere or diminish the experience/task they're working on). If it's not appropriate to verbalize thinking while with a client, quickly chat for a few mins between client interactions to capture what they were thinking\n\n Before shadowing occurs – participants are interviewed or involved in group discussions to learn more about their needs.\n\n During shadowing – the shadow works with a commentator who explains what is being observed throughout the study. This is most often used when the shadow is facing a complex situation where a full explanation (or training) has not been available before shadowing commences.\n\n 📝 Treehouse North CRP\n Staff members \n Amy Couch - Contact Monitor (Licensed social worker)\n\n Tony - Clinical Director\n\n Edward - Residential Counselor\n\n Jaqueline - Program Administrator (licensed MFT)\n\n Bed Status \n Open\n\n Taken\n\n Review\n\n On Hold\n If a client is offsite at an appointment, temporary 51/50. 24 Hour and voluntary it is shorter.\n\n At any point the client can decide they don't want to go to the CRP or they want to leave\n\n Beds by gender to consider showing as a part of availability. Since the rooms are occupied by same gender it would be good to see if they could see 1 male open so that if they received a inquiry about a male needing a room the open status would be more helpful if it included gender. If the room is empty it could be for either gender. (Q: Policy on gender identification)\n\n Referral Statuses \n Accepted - Can be in accepted status but during the drive there, phone call, intake decides not to do the program. Would change to Not Accepted but a specific reason other than better served might be needed for this specific reason.\n\n Intake process very insightful how the client and counselor interact. There are 3 parts to the intake process:\n\n Facility (House rules&hellip;). This is the portion we saw. Lots of paperwork including (takes 30-45 minutes): \n Signing for services provideed and following program rules\n\n Consent form for telehealth with psychiatrist\n\n General information (closest relative, financial responsibility, address, emergency contact, hospital preference)\n\n Anti-hate/anti-violence signature\n\n House rules\n\n Visitation hours\n\n Acknowledgement that this is a voluntary program\n\n Disclosure of PHI to emergency contacts\n\n Authorization to take picture for identification purposes\n\n Consent for emergency treatment\n\n Allergies\n\n Acknowledgement that they will try to find them if they go missing\n\n Personal information\n\n Acknowledgement that if they leave for more than 24 hours they can't come back\n\n Also provide personal hygiene items and clothes\n\n Then they need to shower\n\n Clinical\n\n Medical\n\n Transferring between the same CRP. Example: Treehouse South to Treehouse North. The process happens behind the scenes and is not common. \n Treehouse South sets status to DISCHARGE. (Reason?) Opens bed availability in South.\n\n Treehouse North sees the request on their dashboard. (Treehouse South would see bed availability with gender and know that they could be open and good fit for client so they do an OUTGOING Referral to Treehouse South.)\n\n Treehouse South sees the request and follows the transfer process and their bed status updates.\n\n Typical Stay / Background on CRP \n Typically stay 21 days, older adults have more needs: medical, transient, sometimes don't have IDs which are needed for some outgoing referrals\n It was bumped up from 14 days to 21 days because 14 days was too short to be successful\n\n They are mandated by the state to allow for extensions \n Able to extend stay for the week, every week\n\n Up to 3 months per CCL\n\n Completely voluntary - can walk out at any time but if they leave they're not guaranteed a space if they want to come back\n\n There are six beds, today there were 4 people there when we got there, one person was admitted\n Usually at full capacity\n\n Two to a room, same sex rooms\n\n Not all CRPs are in a home setting, but TREEhouse North is\n Coastal Star is a bigger CRP in an industrial setting and has 15 beds\n\n In 2018 they were contracted with HCA, but TREEhouse North is operated by Telecare\n\n They can see a doctor, nurse, or psychiatrist through telehealth and do medication adjustments\n\n TREEhouse North has an ADU room \n\n Treehouse north has to adhere to DHCS, CCL (Community Care Licensing), and County rules - have to make all three happy\n\n CRPs are 24/7 with staff available at all times\n\n Intake (similar to all other CRPs):\n They have an intake office right next to the garage\n\n All personal items are put in a bug zapper for a couple hours\n\n Any sharps or dangerous objects are put in a locker\n\n Outgoing Referrals \n The outgoing referral process is a very important and mandatory item to complete and part of the program. It is something that is setup early in the accepted or intake process.\n \"Start talking discharge at the time of admission\"\n\n There are sometimes not a lot of places to refer individuals to, so they extend their stay at the CRP\n\n Destinations: older adult services, OASIS (provide more intensive care and help for unhoused - place client same day), outpatient programs, year round emergency shelter beds (majority of the time they're at full capacity\n Will sometimes send them to a supportive environment (family, friends, etc.)\n\n Method: Phone call and fax information (medication, treatment plan, etc.)\n Blank copies linked here \n\n They prefer for the client to lead the referral process and empower the client to make those calls\n However, they will step in if needed\n\n System Usage \n About to switch over to a new EHR through Telecare (Avatar)\n\n CRP staff do have access to IRIS, but it's limited\n They can look up a client and do a client search\n\n Concerns over a new system \n They're not always at their desk, they were worried that an email or text would be missed. Currently when they get a referral they receive a call at the office\n They have 15 minutes to get in touch with the referring party\n\n Since they're not always on their computer they'd like a mobile version\n\n Amy wants a referral to go to all CRPs\n Her goal is that it is easier for CRPs to coordinate care and communicate with each other\n\n Want less admission denials\n\n TAY CRP doesn't see anyone older than 25, but it doesn't harm them to see referrals (especially because there can be missing information in referrals including DOB)\n\n Excited about\n Seeing referral history for their frequent fliers\n\n Info Received on Tustin Children and Tustin TAY Before Visiting\n All Children and TAY CRPs are operated by Waymakers who is contracted by OC (They've been the only provider for forever)\n Children CRPs\n Age range: 12-18\n\n Locations\n Tustin - hub of the referral process\n\n Laguna Beach\n\n Huntington Beach\n\n Average length of stay: 7-10 days\n\n TAY (1 location = Tustin)\n Age range: 18-26\n\n TAY population is unique, so Matthew Kee (Manager for Child and Youth Services) and Seneca (Contract Monitor) said it would be really beneficial to see this\n\n Average length of stay: 10-14 days\n\n Context and change in the county\n Historically, the children and adult programs have been kept very separate, but the county is hoping to bring them together and have the same type of model for similar programs across children and adult (e.g., all CRPs are organized together)\n\n There has been some worry that children and TAY specific needs will get lost in the shuffle\n\n Differences seen in children CRPs (in comparison to adult CRPs)\n Lots of family involvement\n\n Don't have nursing on site (Adult has nursing)\n\n Some psychiatrist hours but limited\n\n Different referral sources, for example hospitals are a larger referral source for children\n Seneca and Matthew expressed that they don't want of all of these people to add their referrals directly to the bed board \n Would be interesting to know why \n\n TAY CRP does not take from hospitals, except for a few specific contracts\n\n Anticipated challenges for the CRP Bed Board\n Waymakers is a very paper bound program. They don't have an EHR and don't have any plans to have an EHR\n\n Providers are meticulous about the details coming and don't accept a referral without full information\n\n OC will have to make it a stipulation of their contract to fill out the Bed Board\n\n Currently Waymakers only does phone calls to provide availability\n\n Anticipated successes for the CRP Bed Board\n Reduce the back and forth and create a level of transparency that children CRPs do not have\n\n Believe staff would like this and would help broaden the number of people who can review referrals (which they've been in the process of trying to do) rather than only 1-2 people doing admissions\n\n Requests from Seneca and Matt\n Ability to print a referral and add it to a client's paper chart at Waymakers\n\n Would like CRPs to be able to see CAT and CSU history - would find this helpful\n\n CRPs have access to IRIS (OC EHR) and can search for a client \n Inpatient contracts do not have access to IRIS, different type of contract\n\n When Shadowing: \n Show them CSU Bed Board Screenshots \n\n Lot of change in the systems and CalAIM documentation, MHSA changes pending, so CRPs may be a bit more anxious about change \n\n Children's CRPs\n Staff Members \n Seneca is the Contract Monitor for CRP Youth programs\n\n Carol Carlson - Director at Waymakers\n\n Chantay - Manager for Tustin?\n\n Childrens CRPs have someone on call at all times (rotates)\n\n General info about the CRPs \n 100% voluntary\n\n Staff at CRPs are LPS designated and can right an involuntary hold\n\n Two clinicians at each house\n\n Summer and fall are slower. October gets busy into spring\n Used to carry a waitlist, but now don't\n\n Crisis needs to occur in OC to qualify for a CRP\n\n Client name and DOB are the most reliable identifiers, phone number is less reliable\n\n Concurrent review is not in play for Childrens yet but it is in place for TAY\n We may want to build in concurrent review just in case since the state requirements for adults typically roll down to childrens\n\n We can focus on building CRPs first and then add later\n\n Bed Assignments \n 16 beds for Children CRPs\n\n Each bedroom is dual occupancy\n\n Bed allocation is very strategic. Examples:\n Gender - There are 2 beds per room, and they keep these rooms same gender\n For childrens, it's organized by sex assigned at birth\n\n For TAY, it depends (need to follow up with Sarah on this one)\n\n Bedrooms are assigned to gender based on need. For example, bedrooms could be have male occupants one day and female occupants the next depending on need\n\n Sometimes there are two bedrooms that share a bathroom (e.g., TAY), in which case they will keep everyone on that floor the same gender\n\n Location - they try to send the client to the CRP closest to them, but this doesn't always work based on availability and other factors\n\n If a hospital releases many clients on the same day to a CRP, then Waymakers tries to split clients up\n\n If a client could potentially to be violent to their roommate, then they will likely have them stay by themselves - this is uncommon but happens\n\n If a client is known for trying to form a romantic relationship with their roommate, then they will likely have them stay by themselves\n\n For these reasons, they would rather not show the beds open at each Waymakers location, rather they would like to share the beds open at Waymakers in total\n There are factors which could change where they're going\n\n They have also experienced pain points where a hospital tells a client \"You should go to Waymakers Laguna Beach because it's close to your home or close to the beach\" and then the client can't actually go there because of bed availability or competing factors\n\n Process \n ALL incoming referrals are made by phone calls \n Typically they receive a first call to simply ask if a bed is available so that they can offer it to a client\n All calls come into the Tustin location for approval\n\n Then an additional phone call is received when the client is ready for the CRP. These calls are helpful for follow up questions (e.g., violent to friends in the past? violent to family? if only violent to family then they may be able to come to the CRP - nuance may not be able to be captured in a form without some sort of interview screening)\n Help better understand if the client is okay with the program and the rules of the program\n\n Interview the Reporting Party (RP), Client, and Parent - sometimes at different times\n Could be three separate calls or one call\n\n They will accept clients even if their parent is not there (since CAT can see child without parent)\n Serve foster youth and will not speak with parent, will need social workers contact\n\n Generally trying to understand:\n History\n\n Willingness to come\n\n Risk to current clients\n\n Whether client will benefit from the program\n\n Fill out TC form \n Verbally go through the entire page with the client\n\n The second that they start the referral, the bed is on hold for that person, even before it's officially accepted \n 24 hour hold\n\n Have told hospitals to not call unless they're close to discharge\n\n Receive additional information through fax. This information isn't required to accept a referral, but it's helpful to validate info\n\n Staff calls one of the three staff members to get approval for assigning a client to a bed\n\n Client comes in and receives care. They are provided with outgoing referrals. Therapist will follow up with the provider for outgoing referrals maybe but not a typical path. Only stabilizing and linking with ongoing care\n\n Referral sources \n 80% are hospital step downs or CAT\n\n Inpatient \n\n Rarely IHCS or psychiatrist at county clinic\n\n Tools \n No EHR - all paper charts\n\n Every location has a shelter roster of every client in paper forms\n\n They do use IRIS for every client\n Progress notes are in IRIS for billing\n\n They also use the continuum of care report in IRIS and a census report that shows past history with the CRP \n They can look up by client name and birthday\n\n Feature requests\n Want the ability to print out referral so that it can be incorporated into their paper chart\n\n Access offsite while they're at home\n\n Mobile optimized (get calls in the grocery store, so it would be more private if they could just pull it up on their phone)\n Not typically working at a desk\n\n Since there are three staff members that approve all referrals, they would like to receive a notification for this \n Could all receive a notification\n\n Waymakers TAY CRP\n Staff \n Jordan\n\n Marissa - clinician\n\n Lisa - Program Director (on leave)\n\n General info about the Waymakers TAY CRP \n 6 beds\n 2 pods\n 2 dual occupancy bedrooms upstairs (single gender) - unlike children's they will have rooms based on gender not sex assigned at birth\n\n 1 dual occupancy bedroom downstairs\n\n Ages: 18-25\n\n Waymakers TAY opened in March 2022\n\n Do not want to indicate that it is a 21 day program because they do not guarantee stay for that long. It is a crisis stabilization program\n\n Non ambulatory and self administer \n\n If they fall between between 18-25 call here first. If a referral sources gets denied then they can send referral elsewhere\n\n More calls later in the evening or middle of the night\n\n Differences between TAY and Childrens \n Referral questions\n All adults use the same referring forms, however TAY is not on the adult form, it's a Tay specific form because licensing is different \n\n Currently ask about employment or school and how they are going to be able to dedicate time to a program if they have a job or are in school. Typically people who have a 40 hour job are not in crisis\n\n CRP does not talk to the parent\n\n Smoke / drug dependency\n Many residents are nicotine dependent but Tustin TAY is smoke free\n\n Population comorbidity with drug use and may require medical clearance\n\n Need to specify with clients that this is a mental health crisis facility, not a housing resource\n Need to review what actually means crisis: dts, dto, gd\n\n Need to understand the crisis because the CRP does not technically help people that are still in crisis. There needs to be space to document referral reason with a narrative (that goes beyond checkboxes)\n\n TAY can take pregnant adults\n\n Identifiers are primarily name and DOB. Do not always get an address provided\n\n Providing updates on bed capacity \n At the beginning of each day, TAY CRP emails a census to CSU Program Directors providing bed availability\n Then at each shift change (three times a day) the TAY CRP will call each CSU with bed availability\n\n Referral Sources \n Most common: HCA CSU and College Hospital CSU\n\n Do NOT take from hospitals\n\n Outgoing Referrals \n FSP (STAY) a place for clients to live, long term outpatient\n STAY is under pathways project \n\n 50% go to STAY. STAY only works with Tay (16-25)\n\n Make referral to STAY through fax or email. Karen at STAY receives referrals and let them know if they're admitted\n Karen emails or calls to let them know they were admitted and will go to Waymakers TAY to meet with the client\n\n Clients that come here and have oftentimes been linked with STAY before \n\n A script describing the program is read after referral documentation is completed \n CRP provides client with information and ask if they have understood\n Could be part of the initial referral form\n\n They would also like to document whether the physicians report has been completed as it is required within 72 hours of a client physically being there\n Checkbox to say whether it's been completed\n\n CSU could also add it as an attachment\n\n Medical questions (likely will not be included in the bed board) \n Prescriptions are a part of the intake (e.g., current meds, whether a script needs to be sent to the pharmacy, etc.). Won't deny referral but they may put a hold on a bed while they're working on medications\n\n Meds are not entered into iris\n\n More of a checklist for do they have meds needed, are they nicotine dependent"

The first meeting is to collectively determine what we need the data architecture to accomplish , then following meetings are to plan how we want to accomplish that. \n Reference Documents \n Please Review These Before First Meeting\n OC Program R&L Status Fields \n\n Current Referral Data Tables (CAT & OC Links) \n\n Optional Review\n CRP Bed Board + Referrals & Linkages (R&L) PRD \n\n CCMU Project Plan (includes current Chorus app that will utilize the determine data structure) \n\n Meeting \n Meeting Outcome Goal \n Suggested Discussion Questions \n Notes \n\n Data Sharing BrainStorm \n\n Attendees \n Addie Nakatani\n\n Christy Forte\n\n Patrick Jeter\n\n Shane Bai\n\n Austin Heap\n\n Julie Jessup\n\n Mayra Solano\n\n Define what the data architecture and data sharing among apps needs to accomplish to align with: \n client requirements\n\n chorus requirements\n\n platform capacity (current & future)\n\n future expansion to additional R&L programs\n\n consent management \n\n *Addie will bring spreadsheet for client requirements\n What are the client's reporting requirements \n CP-3234 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n What kind of meta-data needs to be captured?\n Time stamp? Yes\n\n Who? Yes\n\n Haven't heard of anything specific to analytics yet. However this could inform metadata structure:\n Does the county want to know what the conversion rate is for county operated vs county contracted?\n\n What are the actual fields that should be shared among those who have access to R&L data \n Client profiles across Crisis (OC Links, CAT, CRP, CSU, O&E)\n\n Referral/Case history - Among the crisis care system (OC Links, CAT, CRP, CSU), we will likely share all past history\n O&E - TBD\n\n Once we cross over into SUD programs, sharing SUD history will require an Authorization to Disclose (ATD) which identifies programs that the client has allowed the county to send data to\n Can we tie the ATD to the client's profile and add fields to specify which programs can see certain data?\n\n R&L Statuses \n OC Program R&L Status Fields \n\n \"Requested\" status \n What logic would help user navigate client cases for those who were not accepted but still require services?\n\n Which programs if any, may require separate data tables? \n\n Action items: \n Addie to reach out to Sharon, CRPs, CSUs, O&E to see if they need any data or analytics coming out of Referrals & Linkages\n\n Addie to add PT example to ticket describing how there could be a first outgoing referral CP-3234 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n Addie to email ask for signature sheet to Bill and Mike. Provide pre-read so that they have context. Need signatures on what data is accessible for all county contracted CRPs\n Identify what fields will be viewable, including:\n Link out to Patrick's Data Dictionary\n\n Pros\n Could help provide care and provide clinical context\n\n Cons\n Could ignore referrals\n\n Addie put documentation on Statuses in the PRD instead of the ticket since it's more ongoing\n\n Notes \n OC Warmline - should this be included in this initial pilot? Maybe not too big\n NAMI will be separate client list\n\n Christy, Patrick and Austin are thinking about having separate apps, with one master app\n Will definitely need one client list (except for NAMI)\n\n Implied that data duplication is much higher than 20%\n\n They also implied that it is challenging to get reliable info for client profiles\n\n Data Architecture: Strategic Planning \n\n Attendees \n Addie Nakatani\n\n Armen Arevian\n\n Christy Forte\n\n Patrick Jeter\n\n Austin Heap\n\n Sarah Burdette\n\n Phoenix\n\n Based on what data sharing among apps needs to accomplish, determine HOW we want to plan the data architecture to align with the need. \n If there are outstanding questions: \n Identify questions and assign point person responsible for follow up at next meeting\n Should Chorus depreciate the repetitive tables or use data replication based on existing tables?\n\n Should Chorus refactoring existing apps or borrow from what's already been created among apps for R&L data sharing? \n\n (focused on R&L and informed by: implications, risks, benefits, etc.) \n Post Meeting Action Items: \n\n 1 \n complete \n Sarah schedule and Audit Log Technical Review meeting with Austin, Armen, Christy F, Patrick, and others \n\n 2 \n complete \n Addie will make a data architecture review doc to share with client , will present and iterate this Thursday \n\n 3 \n complete \n Sarah will make a synthesis of things to flag for Sharon \n\n Post Meeting Question Synthesis \n Internal Questions to be addressed \n For programs using the Universal Portal for R&L, how will their data be accounted for in the single Single data Repository? \n\n For programs who don't have access to view client history in the data repository app how do we reconcile their access (e.g. Warmline)?\n\n Should we avoid syncing our mater client index with their mater patient index?\n What are the risks and benefits, and potential solutions?\n\n How do we want to set up mechanisms for county approval \"sign-offs\" for client attributes programs will have access to? We won't share client data across programs unless county individually approves each program access \n\n Questions & Implications to bring to Sharon \n Some programs such as Warmline will not be able to see client history. We will need to develop a formal procedure for determining program privileges to access to client records. \n What programs should not be included in addition to Warmline for client history access\n\n What implications should we consider for client records that do not have client access shared? \n\n What fields should be regularly updated via EHR data? \n\n Notes \n Data Architecture Suggested Approach \n Create an ID management app data pool to use data sharing across apps (Single Data Repository)\n\n Put in place basic data governance \n pick appropriate data attributes that align with this \n\n Decide which data attributes are allowable for access across other data apps \n can have provisions for various table access for different programs and can lead to a consolidated client record \n\n If other apps are allowed to see the particular data attribute, this can be updated and simple to develop \n\n Benefits \n Allows for configuration for each program based on their needs\n\n One mater list that includes as many client attributes as we can account for and up to date client attributes could align with and support EHR record matching \n\n The approach ie essentially one apps with a central data repository that various other apps draw from\n\n Data repository Structure\n One table with referral requests, origin source, destination sources, requestor,\n\n Master Patient Index in the data repository app \n\n Program Restrictions\n E.g. OC Warmline shouldn't have access to view client history\n\n all CRPs can look up clients \n\n non-CRP clients who are using R&L who have been scoped out so far can all look up clients currently \n\n Addie will work on Pros & Cons list to facilitate this discussion with Sharon \n\n Sharing data among apps and being able to traverse tables and filtering and security \n this adds more complexity \n\n Consider permissions on editing some sets of records vs another set of records\n This could get around filtering \n\n Need to make sure the author is clear on which records are shown \n\n Unknown:\n County contracted programs we don't know their perspective \n\n Sharon's idea to get R&L through compliance if they can currently look up a patient via IRIS patient look up, then they should be able to access R&L data \n\n Dependency\n Data Sharing among apps\n\n Most are in code review\n They have a gap around audit features (High Priority) \n Making app log simple across apps \n currently unclear if it's broken \n need to verify that it's working\n\n export logs to show theres a record of table changes \n\n Need it for sharing resources and referrals across apps \n\n Could in theory start to test it on test apps (not real apps) \n\n Architectured for it to be the same as OC Links, may need a technical evaluation of this \n\n One table and read/write to the table, not copy it to each apps own table\n\n Need to understand in OC Links\n\n if the variable will change for the one legacy app or migrate it\n\n Working on MVP\n\n Austin will do a technical review of this feature, look at the code, and see if he has any questions\n Need to have Austin up to speed on this and then have a quick review to make sure it makes sense for the technical implementations \n\n Goal is early next week for Austin on onboard and circle back (he'll set up a time) \n\n Austin will surface unknowns and scope leaking \n\n Data Architecture: Internal Follow Up Meeting \n\n Review answers to outstanding questions and decide on proposed data architecture approach \n Outstanding questions that resulted from previous strategic planning follow up meeting\n Reviewed Addie's Data Architecture Overview Doc \n IF not everyone has access then how are clients matched? \n For programs that don't have access how do we manage patient records? \n\n Where do the rest of the programs fit into this larger referral process?\n this needs to be an internal technical discussoin\n\n What does the county need to do their jobs vs admin perspective?\n\n Need firm data attributes from what is shared out from central out to various apps \n\n Talk to OC about what data attributes should be considered?\n\n What the process should be accounted for when planning data sharing among programs? \n\n Risk: need to make sure it's clear we're not building too many apps, word it as assuming it's all on the same app\n\n Defined persona's for different types of referral programs\n\n List of resources\n Broader list in OC Nav and a narrow version of the list in OC Links \n OC Links has additional data attributes not reflected in the Navigator\n\n need to reconcile and consolidate among the two\n\n Goal is for Chorus to only manage one set of data \n\n If there are description differences, how do we reconcile this \n\n Status\n IF a person is discharged they're still linked so needs to be accounted for via linked table\n\n Log plan\n could complicate reporting\n\n How do you know how many were linked?\n\n Program status and then a referral status in a the table so we can pull reports \n\n Should have a separate log to track changes \n\n Two status\n Referral status\n\n Then program status\n outcome that is specific to needs of program e.g. discharged which would be specific to some programs but not others \n\n Should have an ID record for program status \n\n Someone could go into the same status twice \n\n Risk: Be mindful of language for \"data sharing\" \n it's all in the same app and who can see what in the app \n\n Data Architecture: Partnered Planning with Client \n\n Addie Nakatani\n\n Armen Arevian\n\n Sarah Burdette\n\n Phoenix? \n\n Present data Architecture draft plan to Sharon and her team for feedback and iteration\n Does this data architecture approach allow OC and pertinent stakeholders to access the data exports needed for reporting and metric tracking?\n\n Internal Iteration \n\n Addie Nakatani\n\n Armen Arevian\n\n Christy Forte\n\n Patrick Jeter\n\n Austin Heap\n\n Sarah Burdette\n\n Meet to integrate client feedback to inform data Architecture plan\n How long will implementation of centralized third party application take?\n How will centralized data repository implementation impact scheduled build times for other products. \n How many tables from OC Links will be moved into the 3rd party app?\n\n Goal date for Data Architecture Approach Determined"

Examples: name, demographics, contact info, insurance, safety info (e.g., weapons history)\n\n Chorus Master Client Index (MCI) \n The current client data table stored in the OC Links Application which is used for OC Links, CAT, O&E and will be used for CRPs and CSUs in the near future. This will ultimately be moved into a separate data layer and send/receive data from the program level apps. \n It is being called the Chorus MCI to distinguish it from the IRIS MPI.\n\n Referral data \n Information specific to a single referral. Examples:\n Source program - which individual program is the referral coming from? (e.g., Waymakers CRP in Laguna Beach)\n\n Destination program - which individual program is the referral going to?\n\n Status & reason\n\n Historical data \n Past referral and case history across 1+ programs .

When the assessment is cleared?\n\n Requirements\n Statuses \n Accepted and Linked\n These are key statuses and time stamps to record. When a user moves beyond the statuses of accepted or linked, the fact that they were accepted or linked still needs to be documented\n ie: a referral doesn't stop being linked because someone was discharged\n\n Updating statuses\n Users should only see the statuses that are up next (ex: if a referral is in the status of \"Accepted\", then the only statuses available should be \"Linked\" and \"Not Linked\")\n\n Editing a status\n Users need ability to edit a status\n Date/time or reason can be edited easily\n\n Editing status will take user to a warning screen that all subsequent statuses will be overwritten \n\n Users need ability to clear a status\n\n Current status\n At any point, OC will need to quickly identify the current status that a referral is in\n\n Reporting\n Number of referrals linked\n\n Number of referrals accepted\n\n Current status of all referrals\n\n Two distinct fields are needed \n Need one field for referral status\n\n Need a separate field for program_status and that is the status that is applicable to the program\n\n Time stamps \n All statuses need time stamps \n\n OC wants ability to save and export multiple time stamps for a single status\n Ex: Referral is \"Requested\" > CRP A updates status to \"In Review\" > CRP A updates status to \"Not Accepted by Program within Referral Group\" > CRP A updates referral to \"Requested\"\n OC wants a time stamp for both times referral went to \"Requested\"\n\n OC needs to know when the 1st outgoing referral was requested, even if other outgoing referrals are later added\n Ex: Client goes to doctor > Doctor refers client to PT > PT doesn't accept referral > Doctor refers to X-ray\n OC cares about both outgoing referral requests and timestamps, but they really need to know when that very first referral to PT occurred\n\n R&L for Programs Outside of Chorus\n In progress"

The key pain points we have with this approach:\n It is taking up SA resources that would be better spent working on active builds. \n\n It is not always clear which users should have access to which zones.\n\n It is cluttering the Zendesk ticketing system with non-critical work.\n\n It is likely that because the OC admins do not have clear visibility into the existing list of users, there may be users that are no longer active or should be removed from the app.\n\n Terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n Program\n A program within the Orange County HCA ecosystem.\n County-Operated Program Examples\n OC Links\n\n CAT (Crisis Assessment Team)\n\n O&E (Outreach & Engagement)\n\n UAF (UAF Surveys conducted by O&E)\n\n County-Contracted Program Examples\n OC Warmline\n\n CRPs (Crisis Residential Programs)\n\n CSUs (Crisis Stabilization Units)\n\n OC Super Admin (placeholder title)\n Client's term for a user with privileges to:\n Make another user a Service Chief\n\n Access a list of all existing users in OC\n\n Ability to add, edit, and remove OC users\n\n Service Chief (placeholder title)\n Client's term for a user with privileges to: \n Access a list of existing users related to their program\n\n Ability to add, edit, and remove users from their program\n\n Program Staff (placeholder title)\n Client's term for a user with privileges to: \n Access specific zones within the OC app\n\n Roles\n Client's term to differentiate staff member types.

Or can this track of work be rolled out afterwards? \n\n How will SSO work with this? \n Per our meeting with Sharon on 07/19, we may need to have SSO first and then apply access management once it has been implemented. We plan to have more internal and external meetings with HCA IT in the coming weeks to get this scoped out more.\n SSO for OC is a separate track of work. See OC SSO & User Provisioning PRD for more information.\n Engineering\n\n Assumption: We do not want to give the client the ability to edit what Client Groups a Role will be assigned to, right? (Meaning users given a certain Role will be assigned a certain Client Group which has predetermined access to certain Zones.)\n Product Manager / Client\n\n Are we going to give OC Super Admins and Service Chiefs the ability to \"delete\" users? How do we want to define \"delete\"?\n Compliance / Engineering\n\n How should \"inactive\" users be handled? Will they show up on a separate table or will they be shown in the full list of users? How will we visually want to distinguish them?\n Product Manager / Client\n\n Currently, response sets cannot handle the removal/deletion of users from Groups.\n Will require engineering to support.\n Engineering\n\n Is it a 1:1 relationship for Role to Client Group? Or can 1 Role be assigned to multiple Client Groups?\n Product Manager / Client\n\n Does it make more sense to:\n Option 1: Extend the existing Admin I Zone\n\n Option 2: Create a new Zone\n\n Solutions Architect"

Refers to the broader group and high-level stakeholders.\n\n PEI\n Prevention & Early Intervention: a funding source to provide preventative care for individuals with serious mental illness. Orange County Health Care Agency contracts with about 26 providers who are PEI-funded.\n\n PIF\n Participant Information Form: a document that captures the participant's basic and demographic information.\n\n Participant\n Often referred to as \"client\" in Chorus, but individuals receiving care from PEI programs are called \"participants.\"\n\n Qualtrics\n A software that OC HCA and contracted service providers use for some documentation.\n\n Objective\n We will design and build a case/client management system with a thorough demographics form for 26 county-contracted service providers who provide PEI services. When complete, users will be able to receive incoming referrals, enroll participants, fill out the demographics form, discharge participants at the end of their care, and document referrals.\n Broader Context\n OC HCA has previously been managing these forms through Qualtrics, which was not meeting their needs. OC approached Chorus to build a better experience. There is also a referrals and linkages component that will come into play and is easier for Chorus to manage. \n Personas\n User Class \n Description \n Key Goal \n Control \n Persona \n\n Service Provider\n Entity that provides supportive services to individuals with a mental health need. \n Record participant's basic & demographic information \n\n Enrolls participant in services (if eligible) and records enrollment date\n\n Refers participant to additional supportive services if needed\n\n Discharges and provides 2 surveys to participant \n\n Access to PIF\n\n Only their participants\n\n Denise\n Age: 42\n\n Occupation: Clinical social worker\n\n Education level: advanced degree\n\n Tech savvy: 7/10\n\n Participant \n An individual with a mental health need who is referred (incl. self-referred) to a service provider and receives supportive services.\n Takes anonymous satisfaction survey (not in Chorus – we will link to survey or send via SMS) \n\n Takes perceived impact survey; feedback is tied to participant.\n\n Links to surveys will be provided to participant.\n\n Richard\n Tech savvy: 3/10\n\n OC HCA\n Someone at the county who provisions access to Chorus for county-contracted providers.\n Control access to Chorus forms & provision accounts for county-contracted providers \n\n Administrator module\n\n Sharon \n Tech savvy: 10/10\n\n Key User Stories\n User: Service Provider\n As a Service Provider, I want to fill out the Participant Information Form and log information as necessary so that the participant can receive care and the required data is collected. \n\n User: Participant\n As a PEI participant, I want to fill out the anonymous satisfaction survey and perceived impact survey so that the provider can improve their services for me and future participants.\n\n User: OC HCA admin\n As an admin at the county, I want to control which service providers have access to which case management systems so that access is properly managed.\n\n As an admin at the county, I want to receive data specific to each PEI program on a monthly basis.\n\n Critical User Journey(s)\n User: Service Provider\n Participant is referred, or self refers, to the program. \n\n Provider opens the form to collect basic and demographic information. \n\n Provider enrolls the participant (based on eligibility criteria), documents enrollment date. \n\n Provider refers the participant to supportive services ( e.g., food pantry, outpatient ) at any point in time. \n\n Provider discharges participant. \n\n There's one program - Working Wardrobe - that will need case notes and documentation. \n\n User: Participant\n At the point of discharge, participant needs to take 2 surveys:\n Satisfaction survey in Qualtrics - this is anonymous and not attached to participant ID - isn't in Chorus. We link to the Qualtrics survey or send via SMS. \n\n Perceived Impact questions – needs to be attached to participant ID - it's a form with 8-9 statements and a Likert scale for responses. There are three versions: General, Older Adults, and Parenting. HCA will tell us which provider uses which form - each provider uses only one of the three. \n Short-term HCA is asking providers to continue using paper format to collect this feedback since HCA doesn't know how participants would fill out the form technology-wise on site. \n\n User: OC HCA Admin\n Admin provisions access to contracted providers via access management module.\n\n Admins receive data stored for each PEI provider.\n\n Constraints\n What compliance guidelines, budgetary/timeline restrictions, or other factors need to be kept in mind? \n Need MVP solution by \n To meet this deadline, we are targeting for release.\n\n Requirements\n Data\n Each PEI provider has it's own data table. Data should not cross between providers or other OC programs.\n\n Case Management System\n Dashboard \n Participants need to be searchable by name and DOB as forms can be filled out/edited/modified during the duration of their care. \n Basic info fields that are required in order to be searchable are name and DOB.\n\n Participant Information Form, Enrollment and Discharge\n We will use a standardized form across all programs (Warmline, O&E, etc.)\n Demographic questions have a specific logic (out of scope) \n We may forgo implementing logic for ease of implementation and short timelines.\n\n Perceived Impact Form\n Needs to be attached to participant ID, so this will be filled out in Chorus.\n\n Form with 8-9 statements and a Likert scale for responses\n 3 versions: General, Older Adults, and Parenting. HCA will tell us which provider uses which form - each provider uses only one of the three. \n\n Participant Satisfaction Survey \n Anonymously filled out in Qualtrics (a software the providers have access to). \n This form will NOT be filled out in Chorus, but we will provide a way for the participant to access it. \n We can do this via QR code, email, and/or SMS . (out of scope)\n\n Referrals and Linkages\n Providers can document referral to the type of supportive service available (e.g., outpatient services, food pantry) and manually confirm whether the participant accepted or declined the referral. Eventually, we'd need to roll out \"closed-loop\" feature where providers can refer to the specific organization but this will require HCA creating the hierarchy of resources for referral (this is currently underway via OC Navigator). \n\n Role-Based Access\n Each provider needs only to see its own participants\n\n Each provider may have a different Perceived Impact form attached to the participant\n\n We'll need to provide HCA admins a way to do user account provisioning, since these are county-contracted providers who are not currently in Chorus. \n\n Activity Log\n Time stamp all changes to participant information.\n This is for audit purposes only so just need to make sure we can trace the data from the backend.

I'd have each of you shadow individually, and try to shadow as many as you can. An ideal data set would be 5+ people. If we can shadow 5+ people and observe 10-20 use cases, that would be amazing (not sure how long a 'case' will last, but you get the idea: more is better).\n\n Ask the person you're shadowing to think out loud (when appropriate) to talk through what they're feeling, what they need, what they dislike, what they like. (as long as it doesn't interfere or diminish the experience/task they're working on). If it's not appropriate to verbalize thinking while with a client, quickly chat for a few mins between client interactions to capture what they were thinking\n\n Questions \n Can I see how you typically use Chorus?\n What do you like?\n\n What do you dislike?\n\n Should outreach workers have access to case details on mobile if they have not yet accepted the case? This is currently the case in CAT.\n\n How is UAF survey currently being utilized? How many times is it filled out?\n\n Is it helpful to see an alarm indication or flag on Dispatch Dashboard after a certain number of attempts?\n\n Do you think it would be useful to see number of cards on each status?\n\n How do dispatchers currently determine which Outreach Worker is closest to the participant?\n\n What Tabs are you using most frequently and least frequently?\n\n How do you send referrals?\n What information do you send?\n\n Do you receive confirmation that a referral has been accepted? Linked?\n\n How do you receive referrals?\n What information do you receive?\n\n Do you send confirmation that a referral has been accepted? Linked?\n\n What other systems are you currently entering client data into?\n Where is the information you're entering duplicative?\n\n Would it be helpful to see client history?\n\n Any feedback on the statuses or reasons?\n\n Any additional information that you would like to record in Chorus?\n Any information that you would like to not have to record in Chorus?\n\n Notes from Mike Squibb: \n If possible, get together right after the research ends and discuss high level findings while it's all fresh in your mind.\n\n Synthesize findings asap after (the next day, for example) so you can create a user journey (or journeys) and plot out where there's friction, needs, pain points, wins, etc.\n\n Findings\n User Journey Map \n Triage/Dispatch Clinician \n Outreach/Field Clinician \n\n Systems Used \n\n Teams Message \n Coordinating communication among O&E office staff (Supervisors/ Officer of the Day) \n\n Incoming requests from OC Links \n\n Email \n\n HMIS/Clarity \n Shelter and Housing History \n\n Care team allocation \n\n IRIS \n Mental Health history & SUD History \n clinician will note either or both when making a case for dispatch to alert field staff if they may need to be mindful of safety or other client needs \n\n Clinic location if they've previously received mental health services \n\n If a client has an existing appointment or missed an appointment \n\n Chorus \n Client management and dispatch \n\n May review if there a CAT notes\n could indicate the need for safety measures for outreach clinicians \n\n Phone \n O&E potential clients \n\n Google Maps \n To help a client identify their location and ideal meeting place for the client and their clinician \n\n CALSAWS \n To review a client's benefits (MediCal, EBT, CashAid, Social Security Benefits) \n\n Chorus \n UAF Survey\n\n Clarity/HMIS \n Shelter and Housing History \n\n Care team allocation \n\n Paper and Pen \n Client case notes \n\n Email \n\n Phone \n\n Pain Points \n\n Triage staff shadowed: Monica & Caroline \n Extremely slow loading page and filtering pages \n Navigating between O&E tab and Client tab took 15-30 seconds each time \n Both triage clinicians used paper to supplement the Chorus app to account for slow wait time \n Would write things onto paper and then transfer it to Chorus app after the call \n\n The workflow of the triage worker on the phone less efficient\n\n Triage worker was losing trust with the system and was losing the trust of the client they were on the phone with because the person on the phone had to wait while the page was loading\n\n Filtering a page for client or staff details took 60 seconds\n\n If an existing O&E client case has a clinician assigned to it, the triage clinician is not able to see the staff who was assigned to the case. \n To find out who was assigned to the case, the triage clinicians must spend additional time sending teams messages to staff and/supervisors asking if anyone knows or remembers what clinician was assigned to a client case\n\n Because triage staff do not have the ability to see clinicians assigned to client cases they experience the following two problems: \n Often times O&E clients call from various phone numbers because they do not have consistent phone access. When a client calls in to check on the status of their case, if a triage worker is not able to quickly identify \n\n Triage/dispatch clinicians get really busy with phone calls and documenting. Because of this, sometimes and so they chose to enter their call data into Chorus after the call has happened \n slow loading pages is one of the main reason why staff will enter their call data after the call \n\n Triage/Dispatch clinicians don't find the dashboard of Recent Callers list useful for their needs \n The client page and the O&E tab are their most frequently used paged\n\n Triage clinicians review how many times a client with an existing Chorus case may have received CAT services, but it is difficult for them to see a quick overview of how many times a client has received CAT services \n Triage clinicians currently have to scroll through a client's entire case history in the detail tab to look for frequency of service use \n\n Sometimes triage clinicians type out an entire client case, then accidentally click away from the screen without clicking safe. Because there is not an autosave feature, they lose all their work \n This leads them to writing things down on paper and then transferring to Chorus later \n\n Triage workers have to log all calls even if the caller is not eligible for O&E services or does not provide a name. Because Chorus requires a name, the triage clinician logs the call by using XXXX XXXXX for first and last name \n They would like the ability to document that the caller wasn't eligible for services and/or did not provide a name \n\n Outreach Staff Shadowed: Ronnie, Tamara\n Geolocation \n when outreach clinicians refresh a location it doesn't work, and the pin will be the last place the clinician was located\n\n Even when Geolocation pins a clinician's location, they still have to type out street names which takes additional time and is redundant for their workflow \n\n Friction and inefficiencies navigating between Chorus and UAF survey apps \n\n Outreach workers do not have a digital space to document client case notes within Chorus \n Outreach clinicians use a paper referral form in the field to take notes or take notes for the client in an email \n\n They have to retype their notes later and share with their supervisor \n\n UAF Survey is often flow and freezes \n\n Potential Bug: time stamp displayed same time for all the surveys even when they weren't all updated at the same time\n\n Workflow Overview \n\n Workflow Overview \n Triage clinicians receive clients from one of two sources: \n 800 Number\n\n OC Links \n\n Triage Clinicians manage calls and program communication via the following: \n OC Links will send a teams message to an O&E Triage clinician asking about client details and if they're able to take a client call \n\n Program only serve currently homeless individuals in orange county\n If the call is form a homeless family, the triage clinicians will refer the client to Family Collaborative Solutions or 211\n \"Family\" is defined as a caretaker with a youth under 18 with them \n\n If a call is for someone at risk of homelessness they would refers them to another resource\n\n Sometime triage clinicians receive calls from clients who have an existing case \n client are calling to receive a status of their case \n\n a clinician will look up a client in HMIS to see if a client has connected with a clinician in the field (allows clinician to see their care team for shelter or housing engagement)\n\n Sometimes outreach workers run into other clinicians clients while they're in the field and are able to connect with them to get updates, provide resources, and check in\n\n UAF survey used frequently in the field \n data collection method\n\n completed on clinician's iPad\n\n submitted per client interaction \n\n Must be submitted at the location the survey was taken for Geolocation to save their location\n\n Client engagement documented:\n In UAF survey\n\n In Clarity if engaging with housing resources \n\n notes on paper \n\n Common variables documented during clinician and client engagement: \n shelter, treatment, language, transportation \n\n Outreach clinicians link their clients to medical appointments and help them with their paperwork needed for the appointments \n\n Outreach clinicians help their clients with connecting with bed resources by putting them on the list for availability \n\n Frequent resources Outreach clinicians support clients with: \n Outreach clinicians provide client's buss passes frequently \n documented in UAF survey \n\n Social services\n\n Food stamps/EBT\n\n Mental Health Resources \n\n Sobering Station \n\n Taxi service for transportation to resources \n\n Outreach clinicians have to fill out the name of their co-staff \n\n Outreach clinicians complete all client info while they are going through the UAF survey \n\n Outreach clinicians close a client case in any of the following: \n after 3 failed attempts \n\n after the contact has been made\n\n if a client refuses help \n\n Housing eligibility \n eligible for housing if they were homeless for one year\n\n A letter is required to write a letter to get housing support \n\n Som\n\n Potential Requirements From Shadowing \n\n Triage/Dispatch clinician needs the ability to see the following for an existing client record:\n The supervisor who assigned the clinician to the case\n\n The clinician(s) who have worked with the client\n\n Triage/Dispatch clinicians need the ability to to backdate a client record (when updating or making a new client case)\n\n Triage clinicians need the ability to see a quick summary of frequently utilized programs in a client record case history\n e.g. Instead of scrolling through client case history to see how many times a client utilized CAT, they would have a list at the top of the name of programs used and a simple count of how many times the client has used the service \n\n Ability to quickly save the client information they enter into Chorus \n (autosave, or a save button that follows along with them on the screen) \n\n The ability to make an appointment with a client's mental health provider with Chorus\n IRIS integration \n\n The ability to indicate that a caller did not provide their name\n triage clinicians must log all calls in Chorus even if the caller wasn't eligible for services or didn't provide their name\n\n The ability or outreach clinicians to search, find, and edit client records for clients they're not directly assigned to \n\n The ability for outreach clinicians to quickly and easily make a new client record when they are approached by new clients while they are in the field\n\n The ability for outreach clinicians to document in Chorus UAF survey \" Client was not there\" or \"Zero Contacts\" \n staff manually entering zeros currently \n\n The ability for UAF survey to default zeros; staff can quickly populate only what is relevant for their client \n\n The ability for Outreach clinicians to access UAF in O&E mobile app \n\n The ability for outreach clinicians to see the status of a client's referrals, the status of the referral, and if the client was linked \n\n The ability for outreach clinicians to auto-populate the name of their co-staff \n\n The ability for cross stress of an outreach clinician to auto-populate when they are completing the UAF survey \n\n The ability to upload a photo or icon to a client's record\n There are existing client photos in HMIS/Clarity \n\n The ability for outreach clinicians to view previous O&E clinicians a client has worked with to allow outreach clinicians to connect clients with previous staff and for outreach staff to contact previous clinicians for consultation on the client \n\n Questions \n\n What are the distinguishing roles/responsibilities if any from the following roles:\n Officer of the Day\n\n Supervisor\n\n Admin\n If they're different roles which screens do features within chorus do they use?\n\n What are their unique workflows within triage and outreach dispatch"

Sequence out (LOE estimate) \n\n 📚 Glossary\n Term \n Definition \n\n Categories (Primary and Secondary)\n The set groups of resources and programs defined by OC HCA. \n OC Navigator currently has two category fields: Primary (a pick-one) and Secondary (a pick-many). Primary Categories are the primary association with the resource, and determine the icon that is shown in the resource in OC Nav. The intent for Secondary Category was to allow for users to see resources that provide many services, despite being primarily associated with one category.\n\n Service vs Online\n Not extremely important to this conversation, but for reference, OC Navigator distinguishes \"Service\" and \"Online\" resources in the following way:\n Service: Resources that involve interaction with the organization, including hospitals, offices, telehealth and even hotlines.\n\n Online: Resources that are more self-directed, including toolkits, resource directories and articles.\n\n These are currently mutually exclusive.\n\n Organization\n Describes the group that provides the resource, ex. School Readiness Tutoring - YMCA .\n The previous process of showing this on OC Navigator was through the title, but we are beginning to start using an \"By Organization\" field to serve double duty for Services and Online.\n\n Type (CYBH, AOABH, etc.)\n Currently exists in the OC Links data structure. Describes the funding type (?)\n\n 🔄 Comparing Data Structure between OC Links/Warmline and OC Navigator \n Categories and Types\n Type (OC Links Only, Outdated)\n AOABH Services\n\n AOABH Services SUD Treatment\n\n AQIS\n\n CYBH\n\n Innovation\n\n Navigation & training\n\n Outside of HCA\n\n P&I\n\n Public Health\n\n OC Links/Warmline Category (Outdated)\n Domestic Violence\n\n Education\n\n Financial Support\n\n Hospitals\n\n Housing\n\n Immigration\n\n Law Enforcement\n\n Legal\n\n Medical\n\n Mental Health\n\n Multi-Category\n\n Substance Use Treatment\n\n Transportation\n\n OC Navigator Category\n Family Safety\n\n Learning\n\n Money\n\n Medical\n\n Housing\n\n Legal Help\n\n Mental Wellness\n\n Substance Use\n\n Transportation (Getting Around)\n\n Kids and Families\n\n Basic Needs\n\n Current Differences in Datasets\n Specific to OC Navigator\n Secondary Category\n\n Resource Source\n\n Presence (Service vs Digital)\n\n Items related to Digital Resources (By, Digital Type, App Link, Image + Alt Text)\n\n Keywords (Service, Demographic)\n\n Specific to OC Links\n Fax\n\n County\n\n Country\n\n Parent Agency Type\n\n Alternative Name\n\n Coverage\n\n Coverage Area\n\n Type\n\n Main Contact Name/Email/Phone\n\n Fee Structure Source\n\n Application Process\n\n Documents Required\n\n Volunteer Opportunities\n\n 🌱 Progress So Far \n Resources\n Around late January, I did an audit comparing the OC Links database and the OC Nav resources marked with the OC Links source here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxkTsqhIz7vLj1Wa8slXvNFIG71ZD2gvbvxH4gfw-8k/edit#gid=1939607885 \n This document https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fVbSPFk00qRzPWYP6CvM5QdlSIWSTIZKrs4yyTCBxZY/edit was also created in late March with a summary of what I knew at the time.\n Categories\n The lists below are mapping OC Navigator categories to the closest equivalent in the current OC Links list. These may not be final?\n Categories that can just be added (no overlap)\n (nothing) &rarr; Law Enforcement\n\n Categories that can map:\n Family Safety &rarr; Domestic Violence \n\n Money &rarr; Financial Support\n\n Housing &rarr; Housing\n\n Substance Use &rarr; Substance Use Treatment\n\n Transportation (Getting Around) &rarr; Transportation\n\n Categories that might be able to map, depending on the situation:\n Learning &rarr; Education\n\n Mental Wellness &rarr; Mental Health (q: how do Hospitals fit in here?)\n\n Categories that will require manual review:\n Medical &rarr; Hospitals + Medical\n\n Legal Help &rarr; Immigration + Legal\n\n Multi-Category &rarr; ? (big q: what is the definition of this and how often is it used?)\n\n Basic Needs &rarr; ? (q: how does OC Links currently handle this?)\n\n Kids and Families &rarr; ?\n\n Subcategories\n County is in the process of confirming the list of Mental Wellness and Substance Use subcategories. We haven't revisited the other categories at this point yet.\n Types\n Types currently aren't logged in OC Navigator (apart from in the titles of the resource, ex. Adult and Older Adult Behavioral Health (AOABH) Regional Outpatient Clinic Access Point - Aliso Viejo) so these should be easy to just append onto the dataset.\n Miscellaneous Notes\n Number of active resources in OC Navigator: ~1200\n\n Number of total resources in OC Links: ~450\n\n Estimated overlap: ~350?\n Things on Links that wouldn't show up on Nav: closed referral programs, help lines from other CA counties, police departments, etc.\n\n Chorus variables currently have a limit of 75 columns (+1 for the ID)\n This means that there may be the need for the Unified Database to live in two linked variables (similar to how TFW currently works)\n\n 🫱🏻&zwj;🫲🏽 Dependencies \n County:\n Data governance conversation\n\n Defining categories (?)\n\n Defining subcategories\n\n Updates to Types\n\n Finalizing list of necessary fields\n\n Chorus:\n When will engineering have data sharing across apps? (August 16?)\n\n Plan \n Task \n Description \n Time Estimate \n\n Linking equivalent OC Links and OC Nav resources (de-dupe)\n Looking through all active resources on OC Links and finding the associated resource on Navigator. \n Pretty much creating a Venn diagram on what shows up only on OC Links, what shows up only on OC Nav, and what's on both.\n ~1.5 weeks for one person + 0.5 allowance for formatting and presenting\n (450 resources * 2 minutes each = 15 hours) \n\n Allowance for County Review\n Conversation with County\n Dependency\n\n Confirm new Types and Categories\n Conversation with County\n Dependency\n\n Category Multi-Select for OC Links (~400)\n Review of all OC Links resources (currently single select only)\n Preferably done by County. \n If not, it would take ~2 weeks for one person \n (450 resources * 3 minutes each = 23 hours)\n\n County to provide OC Links resources updated Types\n Conversation with County, will not affect timeline above.\n Dependency\n\n Manual Review of Categories (Assuming OC Links Categories)\n Review of OC Navigator-specific resources to update Categories. \n ~4 weeks for one person\n (800 resources * 3 minutes each = 40 hours)\n Could be less depending on the amount of changes to categories\n\n Design\n Resource entry portal in OC Nav, Warmline or Links\n 1-2 weeks min.\n\n Build\n Resource entry portal in OC Nav, Warmline or Links\n 2 weeks min. (must be after new Types/Categories)\n\n Bulk Upload or Resource Updates\n Either: \n 1) Adding the resources into a fresh database \n 2) Or updating a \"core\" existing database (e.g. OC Navigator)\n Then afterwards pointing everything where it needs to go afterwards (this part might be done during build).\n 1 week min.\n\n ❓ Open questions \n Who will be the one to join the resource tables? Ideally it would be somebody with knowledge of the county resources and also about supportive resources in general. Ex. Calvin, Fabiola, somebody from the County, a contractor. Do they have capacity?\n This task would likely still require involvement by the County to review things that aren't clear and for approval.\n\n How to limit or focus access to certain resources from users of the portals instead of seeing all 900? Playlist? Sorting? Another solution?\n On the other side of things, increasing visibility of other resources?\n\n Design on how to display OC Contracted primarily with OC Navigator set in another way\n\n How to confirm as much as possible whether resources are actually able to accept new clients? (Looking towards the future)\n\n For Calvin : know difference between \"closed loop\" (referral) vs a recommendation\n\n How to handle past and open cases when the databases/labels change over?\n\n Question for SAs: When joining the resources, would it be better to create a new dataset that has all the information bulk uploaded, or to link the two existing datasets with a join table?"

As a result, managing users, permissions, and access across their toolset is cumbersome, expensive, and error prone.\n\n What do we expect to accomplish? \n We will introduce mechanisms for folks to log into Chorus via SSO.\n\n We will introduce tools for authors to manage how those mechanisms will work on their apps.\n\n Will will provide for tools to manage updates between Orange County's management systems and Chorus.\n\n Why is it important? \n Orange County needs to be able to easily manage who can access what at scale.\n\n Chorus team \n Responsible: \n\n Accountable: \n Katy Jeter, Product Manager\n\n Consulted: \n Addie Nakatani\n\n Sarah Burdette\n\n Mike Valdez\n\n Informed: \n\n Jira epics \n\n Figma file \n\n Client impacts \n\n Chorus impacts \n\n Client deadline \n\n Objectives\n Approved Orange County staff members will have full control over the ability to provision and remove staff members for their Chorus app. Users will be able to log into the Chorus app via their Orange County-issued SSO credentials. The Orange County SSO tool (Azure AD), along with Multi-factor Authentication enforcement, will be managed by the Orange County HCA IT team. \n Allow users to safely and securely log into Chorus using Orange County's SSO tool, Azure AD .\n\n Allow authors to customize login rules to ensure that user management and authentication is compliant with their policies.\n\n Keep OC SSO users and Chorus users in sync.\n\n Target Delivery : September 30, 2023 \n Access to specific zones within an Orange County app will be governed manually and separately. \n Terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n SSO\n Single Sign-On.

That user gets just-in-time provisioning in the target Chorus app based on the assigned Azure Group/Client Group .\n\n Authors can set zone access to only allow users from a linked Active Directory authenticating via SSO. \n\n Success metrics\n Goal \n Metric \n\n Allow Orange County to self-manage their user access\n There will be a reduced number or more accurate list of users\n\n Expedite the user provisioning process\n Reduced amount of time spent provisioning accounts\n\n Constraints\n At a high level, Chorus needs to decide what will be our next SSO implementation .\n\n We need to confirm with Orange County if external emails (i.e. emails not managed by Orange County) will also need to be supported by SSO. This will change the SSO option we recommend.\n\n We need to confirm with Orange County if SSO implementation will need to be rolled out per mobile zone/app, OR, if SSO will be rolled out across all zones/apps at the same time.\n This will also determine whether or not we will have just-in-time provisioning available or if we will need to continue pre-provisioning (which is a known security vulnerability).\n\n If zone by zone, we will start with OC Links, then CAT Mobile, etc.\n\n If all zones/apps at the same time, this will be timed with the launch of the Referrals & Linkages project .\n\n We must comply with security, privacy, and compliance rules, standards, and best practices.\n\n Requirements \n The Chorus platform allows SSO authentications from the Azure AD SSO tool . \n\n Users will be provisioned as just-in-time, instead of pre-provisioned to reduce our security risk. \n\n OC IT will need to provision all users requiring access to a given app in Azure AD prior to the agreed upon go-live date for a given app.\n\n Prior to go-live , Chorus will prepare the following:\n Product Manager responsibilities:\n Updated workflow for collecting user information needed for the existing Team portal. \n\n Announcement messages in the respective apps notifying users of the changes and dates for when these will go live.\n\n Customer Success Team responsibilities:\n Training materials for adopting the new account management procedure.\n\n Author Configuration\n Authors must be able to pass in the necessary parameters to connect their user directory to the Chorus app.\n\n Authors should be able to access the app without having to authenticate through OC's SSO. \n\n If an author needs to test a login-gated page as a normal client user, they will need to be added to OC's Azure AD.\n\n Client Login\n If enabled, existing Chorus users may access a login-gated mobile zone using SSO.\n\n User Creation & Conflict Management\n To determine whether an individual exists in both systems, we will match on email address.\n\n If a \"matched account\" has a different first name, last name, or phone number, Chorus will update the associated values in its system\n\n Conflicts\n name\n\n email\n\n phone\n\n Security, Privacy, and Compliance\n All information is safely stored in a way that complies with all rules that apply to Chorus.\n\n If a user is deactivated in OC's SSO system, they are promptly deactivated in Chorus.\n\n Milestones\n Milestone 1\nOrange County Staff\n Milestone 2\nOrange County Contracted Entities \n (ideally) B2B Tenancy/Invite external users \n Milestone 3\nMultiple Azure ADs for \nOrange County Contracted Entities\n (If a contractor uses Azure, OC could create multiple connections this way.) \n\n Release Blockers: \n OC-employed users can sign in with Azure SSO\n\n Release Blockers: \n OC-contracted users can sign in with Azure SSO via the Azure AD B2B tenancy.\n\n For OC-contracted users without the ability to use SSO authentication, Chorus login credentials have MFA enforced.\n\n OC to decide if non-organization emails will be allowed for user accounts so Chorus can support accordingly.\n\n Release Blockers: \n Chorus environments can support multiple IdP connections to multiple OC apps.\n\n Should have: \n Should have: \n Should have: \n\n Nice to have: \n Nice to have: \n Nice to have: \n\n Out of scope\n Ideas\n Files\n Next steps\n\n 1 \n incomplete \n\n Problems to solve\n Open Questions\n Question \n Answer \n Answerer \n Answered on \n\n OC HCA IT QUESTIONS \n\n Are we rolling out SSO per app or all at once?\n Plan to roll out app by app for easier testing, starting with existing apps followed by apps launching in Q3 2023.\n David Castellanos\n 8/1/23\n\n Will all apps require SSO or only some?\n\n Do we need to support SSO access for non-county-operated entities?\n There are 26 non-county contractors with approximately 59 users needing access to various OC apps within Chorus (and growing).\n Instead of connecting to multiple IdPs, the goal is to instead invite guests to the OC Azure AD account via B2B tenancy – waiting to confirm this is a viable option as of 8/1/23.\n OC IT\n 8/1/23\n\n Is MFA a requirement?\n MFA is a requirement for logins via Chorus user credentials only when SSO is not available.\n (Goal is to instead invite guests to Azure AD via B2B tenancy – waiting to confirm this is a viable option as of 8/1/23.)\n OC IT\n 8/1/23\n\n Confirm that they can set MFA on their azure and that that would cover the MFA requirement (that's the common pattern).\n\n Our assumption is that the same Azure AD account will be used across all entities at OC for SSO access. Is this accurate?\n Yes\n OC IT\n 8/1/23\n\n We are assuming that if a user needs to authenticate, they should always be forced to do so via the SSO tool, and should not have the ability to login using Chorus credentials. Is this accurate?\n\n What security and/or data retention policies do we need to follow of in terms of how/when we remove users and user data from Chorus that have been removed from Azure AD?\n\n When can their team test Azure AD B2B tenancy guest invites by? We will need this to test if the Chorus platform can authenticate with these users in the same way as normal OC county staff.\n\n See https://chorusapp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CE/pages/1931542540/Client+SSO+Access+to+Chorus+PRD#%3Aquestion_mark%3A-Open-Questions , Orange County section for additional questions.\n\n CHORUS INTERNAL QUESTIONS \n\n See Client SSO Access to Chorus PRD for more information."

It is designed to expand and transform California's behavioral health system to better serve individuals with, and at risk of, serious mental health issues, and their families. MHSA addresses a broad continuum of prevention, early intervention, and service needs and the necessary infrastructure, technology, and training elements that effectively support the public behavioral health system.\n Recently, a reform rule was implemented where field teams have 60 minutes from the time a call operator (e.g. an OC Navigator) answers a call to determine if there's a need for dispatch and then send a dispatch team.\n\n OC Links\n\n OC Navigator\n A dispatcher who answers calls received by OC Links.\n\n CAT Mobile\n CAT Mobile is the Crisis Assessment Team. They are a team of clinicians that gets dispatched after an OC Navigator (via OC Links) receives a call and they determine a resource needs to be sent to a person in need.\n\n O&E Mobile\n Response and dispatch system for the Outreach & Engagement team\n\n Geotab SDK\n Geotab Software Development Kit .\n\n OC Contacts \n Sharon Ishikawa\n Amy Couch\n Erika Punchard\n Ryan Yowell\n Matthew Kee\n Vanessa Thomas\n Linda Molina\n Omar Leyva\n\n Geotab Contacts\n Drake Zwahlen, Business Development Manager, Public Sector\n Brianne Biczo, Public Sector Account advisor; handles west coast public sector accounts\n\n Objective\n When a call comes in to a given OC program (CAT, O&E, etc.), a dispatcher may need to send a clinician to the caller's location based on the clinician's proximity ETA to the caller, their skillset, and which vehicle they have available to make the dispatch. The solution Chorus provides for OC needs to:\n Improve the efficiency of the dispatch.\n\n Make sure the dispatch is accomplished within the timeframe outlined by the CCMU Program Grant .\n\n Provides better insights into and helps manage the OC workforce capacity.\n\n The goal is to shorten dispatches by minutes. \n Target launch : Spring 2024 \n Broader Context\n Due to a recent MHSA reform, the CAT Mobile team essentially has 60 minutes from call to dispatch arrival.\n A target goal is to have 75% of dispatches arrive within 30 minutes or less .\n\n Orange County plans to have 21 vehicles outfitted with Geotab's hardware by Spring 2024.\n\n Generally, 2 clinicians are assigned to a given fleet vehicle.\n At times, clinicians may need to use their own personal vehicle to respond to a dispatch .\n\n It is possible a pair of clinicians would need to change out during a shift.\n\n There are 2 ADA vans. It is possible that a clinician may need to change out their assigned fleet vehicle for one of these ADA vans during a dispatch.\n\n OC needs to know how long dispatched field workers are spending with each client so they can :\n Understand how long client service sessions are taking.\n\n Use this information to support staff training.\n\n Use this information as data to support additional hiring requests as needed.\n\n Use this information to ensure the safety of staff.\n\n Use this information for their contractual state reporting needs.\n\n Due to union rules, we are allowed to track the geolocation of the vehicles but not the clinicians. \n\n Personas\n If a FigJam exists with user personas, link to it here: https://www.figma.com/file/0gkKqxKmQwj208l1TUEqox/PADs---Project-Creative-Brief?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=fWUDxaTrngntgQGl-1 \n User Class \n Description \n Key Goal \n Control \n Persona \n\n Peer \n Individual who has a mental health condition.

There has been some great feedback and we plan to discuss all their feedback thus far in more detail on Thursday. Some examples of their feedback include:\n Having the case info be on one long page or being able to freely move between tabs.\n\n Wanting a draft area for the call report\n\n Follow up status\n\n Outstanding Features\n ADA Fixes \n Continuous improvements \n\n Received feedback from Dominick (Warmline staff member) in July.\n\n Demographic field updates \n We are currently waiting on the final sign off from Sharon. \n\n Ellie Cho is working on the designs for PEI this week and will begin to focus her efforts on demographic field updates. \n Update existing fields that are changing\n\n Making general UX improvements\n\n Currently looking into solutions for either having all the information in one tab or allowing staff to freely move within the tabs and have the required fields be checked upon submission.\n\n Spanish & Vietnamese Subcontracts \n Ellie will also begin to work on these designs once she is done with PEI.\n\n This workflow will also include chats. \n\n RingCentral integration \n We have not been able to meet with RingCentral to discuss the integration and implementation plan. Based on our latest conversations with The Warmline, we should expect a conversation to occur in the coming weeks. \n\n Participant data migration \n Dependent on demographic field updates. This will require remapping of the fields to align with the demographic field changes. \n\n Once we have the final sign off, we will notify The Warmline and provide a template for them to groom the data.\n\n Resource dataset via bulk upload \n Dependency with OC Links and their resource categories and types discussions. We will wait for them to verify if there are any updates to the existing dataset.\n\n Will occur closer to the launch date.\n\n Concurrent sessions/multi-tab \n This is still currently outstanding and will need to be operating within OC Links. \n\n Currently has an engineering dependency. \n\n Resource Recommendation \n This is a new ask from The Warmline. They would like to add an option to listing down resource recommendations. \n The Warmline only refers to OC Links as they mainly only do resource recommendations. \n\n Do they want just referral or resource recommendation? Maybe both?\n\n We will discuss these requirements further with the team during Thursday's check-in call. \n\n Transfer Phone Number \n This will occur right before launch.\n\n Notes/action items\n Mayra to create ticket for the template that will be used for participant data migration and resource dataset preparation.\n\n Mike to invite Ellie C. and Julie Z. to these biweekly calls moving forward.\n\n Mike and Mayra to ask more about the current staff workflow when they're on the phone.\n\n Decisions\n Type /decision to record the decisions you make in this meeting: \n f8735bf6-ac62-4cfc-b23a-c995ef5a8597 4f807803-03f9-43a0-8800-3b2c38007e8c DECIDED"

Launch\" options below and make a decision.\n\n Timeline : Complete at least 2 weeks prior to launch.\n\n Prepare the Users List \n A Chorus project/program manager works with the program lead to identify users for the new app and their group assignments.\n Important : For contractors, additional information will need to be collected including (employee ID, direct phone/mobile phone, etc.).\n\n A Chorus project manager helps the OC program lead put together training and notification materials to inform users of the SSO login process for accessing Chorus apps.\n\n Timeline : Complete at least 4 days prior to launch.\n\n OC NAR Submissions (Technical Implementation) \n A Chorus project/program manager submits the list of Chorus Client Groups and Zones to the OC Primary Critical System Owner for that Chorus app.\n\n The Primary Critical System Owner submits an OC NAR request to OC/OCHCA IT to complete the following:\n Create an Azure Group for each Chorus Client Group.\n\n Create an Azure App for each Chorus Zone. \n\n Provide which Azure Groups have access to each Azure App.\n\n ***Important*** : Provide the timing of when Azure Apps will be assigned to Azure Groups ( this determines the launch timing! ). Refer to \"2. Create a Launch Plan\" above.\n\n Match all configurations made in Azure to existing Chorus Azure Apps.\n\n Note the target launch date for the new Chorus app.\n\n Timeline : OC/OCHCA IT will need 1 - 2 business days to process.\n\n OC/OCHCA IT will need to process the NAR and securely send back to Chorus the generated Azure Group IDs and Azure App IDs, Tenant IDs, and Client Secrets.\n The Group IDs do not need to be encrypted – only the Azure App creds. \n\n Timeline : Chorus will need 1 - 2 business days to process.\n\n Credentials should be sent by the client to a Chorus IT [EMAIL ADDRESS PENDING] . \n\n Chorus Jira Tickets (Technical Implementation) \n The Chorus project/program manager will submit an https://chorusapp.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1 request to add those credentials to 1Password and share with the Chorus platform admins. \n\n The Chorus product/technical project manager submits a ticket to Engineering to process mapping the Azure Group IDs to the Chorus Client Group IDs.\n\n The Chorus product/technical project manager submits a ticket to Client Innovations to have a platform admin add the Azure App credentials as new IdP options to the Admin Panel.\n\n The Chorus product/technical project manager submits a ticket to Client Innovations for the SA to update the Zone configurations to use the new IdP. \n SAs to make any other necessary adjustments to the app.\n\n Timeline : Chorus will need 1 - 2 business days to process.\n This will be treated as an interrupt ticket to the existing sprint. \n\n Submit the Users List \n The Primary Critical System Owner submits an OC NAR request for adding users to the appropriate Azure Group(s).\n\n OC/OCHCA IT to process the NAR.\n\n Timeline : OC/OCHCA IT will need 1 - 2 business days to process the user list.\n\n Launch – Choose 1 \n Option 1: Chorus App Goes Live Before Users are Added \n OC/OCHCA IT assigns Azure Apps to Azure Groups at the same time Groups are created.\n\n When a user is created and/or added to an Azure Group, the Azure App will show up in the user's dashboard right away and direct links will work immediately.\n\n Timeline : OC/OCHCA IT will need 1 - 2 business days to process the NAR plus up to 24 hours for new users to show up in the Azure system.\n New OC staff members will require up to 24 hours to process (though usually 2 - 4 hours) due to required MIM syncing (part of OC's HR system).\n\n OC contractors will likely process within 1 - 2 hours since they are not part of the MIM syncing.\n\n Option 2: Chorus App Goes Live After Users are Added \n When a user is created and/or added to an Azure Group, the Azure App will NOT yet show up in the user's https://myapps.microsoft.com account and direct links will not work.\n\n OC/OCHCA IT assigns Azure Apps to Groups as a separate step at a designated time. Azure Apps are assigned to Azure Groups after users have been added to those Groups. Once Apps are assigned to Groups, users will see these apps show up in https://myapps.microsoft.com and direct links will work.\n Timeline : 1 - 2 hours to take effect on launch day. (Assumption is that the users have already been processed, which takes up to 3 business days to complete.) \n Recommend hosting an open-ended workshop launch meeting and inviting the following parties to ensure a smooth launch and expedient troubleshooting. There is no set agenda, just a passing of the baton between parties as technical steps are taken to launch SSO and confirm everything is working as intended. The majority of attendees will be on standby and are not expected to participate unless called upon. \n Chorus project manager\n\n Chorus product manager\n\n Chorus director of engineering (can review access logs)\n\n Chorus customer success representative\n\n OC project/program representative\n\n OC IT representative\n\n OCHCA IT representative\n\n Designated OC users to test: group access, device type, internal/external user access, network access, etc.\n\n Implementing SSO for Existing Apps\n [Needs to be fleshed out]\n Project/product managers should work with clients to consider if an \"SSO is coming\" banner in the existing app would be appropriate.\n\n Project/product managers should determine when old users should be removed from the app.\n\n Project/product managers should determine when passwords for all existing users should be deleted.\n\n Managing Groups\n Membership in a Group determines what Zone(s) a user has access to.\n New Groups for Existing Chorus Apps\n Trigger : Chorus or Orange County creates a new Client Group or Azure Group \n Chorus and OC program staff collaborate to define the new Group and which Zone(s) it has access to.\n\n Chorus and/or the authorized OC contact submits a NAR to OC IT to create the Group and assign it to existing Azure Apps.\n\n OC IT creates the Azure Group and sends the new Azure Group ID to Chorus.\n\n A Chorus engineer maps the new Azure Group ID to the Chorus Client Group.\n\n A Chorus author adds the Client Group to the correct Zone(s).\n\n OC program staff then submit a NAR request to OCHCA IT for assignment of users to this new Group. This may take up to 24 hours for their system to process the change. \n\n Managing Zones\n Zone URLs will be available to OC users as direct links or via myapps.microsoft.com based on their Group membership.\n New Zones for Existing Chorus Apps\n Trigger : Chorus creates a new login-gated Zone\n Chorus and OC program staff collaborate to define which Client Group(s) should have access to the Zone.\n\n Chorus and/or the authorized OC contact submits a NAR for the new Azure App (Chorus Zone) to OC IT.\n The ticket needs to include what existing Azure Groups need access to this new Azure App. (Once processed by OC IT, this app will show up in myapps.microsoft.com.)\n\n OC IT securely sends the new Azure App ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret to Chorus.\n\n A Chorus platform admin adds the Azure creds to Admin Panel > Integrations > Active Directory for the given app.\n\n A Chorus author configures the new Zone to use the new Azure App IdP and assigns Client Groups accordingly.\n\n Managing Users\n Managing users is exclusively the responsibility of OC. Chorus should/will/does NOT have any involvement in the adding or removing of users from Chorus apps – this is entirely managed by the OC program staff, OCHCA IT, and OC IT teams. \n Adding Users\n An OC program staff member submits an OC NAR request with the following minimum information:\n Name\n\n Email\n\n App Name(s)\n\n App Group(s)\n\n OC/OCHCA IT processes the ticket. This may take a few business days to complete.\n\n Once processed, users should be able to access their apps automatically via direct link or through myapps.microsoft.com .\n\n Removing Users\n An OC program staff member submits an OC NAR request to remove a user from a given Chorus app.\n\n OC/OCHCA IT processes the ticket. \n\n When that user next attempts to access the Chorus app, they are automatically unable to log in. (This will go into effect within 15 minutes of removal by OC/OCHCA IT.)\n\n O&E (Outreach & Engagement)\n App ID: TBD\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2vrC-xYArFO13b9QyzeEeJSAQnDgIIu3iXnqL5jSPM/edit#gid=1277622550 \n O&E: Roles in a Given Client Group Azure Group / OC Staff Role \n OC Internal use only.

This initiative will cover workflow and implementation enhancements until we reach this point.\n\n Client deadline \n\n Terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n User Presence\n Industry term for the technology that lets applications track 'who is online' on a website -- for example the Slack server that tracks if we're online/offline is their presence server\n\n Objective\n Our objective is to identify user collision points and implement a solution to mitigate problematic outcomes due to multiple users in the same case, specifically data overriding. Success will mean the ability to identify workflow and implementation enhancements to each collision point in the user experience until we reach a platform level user presence solution that will unlock new potential solutions.\n Broader Context\n On all Chorus applications, more specifically OC Links, there is no concept of capturing user presence so the end user has no way of knowing if other users are viewing the same case. This has led to data overrides if multiple users are performing concurrent actions on the same pages or interactions. As we scale and more users utilize our Chorus applications, multiple users will be accessing the same pages, interactions, and submitting simultaneous actions as part of their workflow. We're already starting to see interest in a solution for BHH products.\n Problem Statement\n In OC Links, multiple users (of the same and different user personas) are concurrently accessing the same pages, interactions, and actions leading to data overrides and a misleading result for users. We currently have no way to identify which and when users are accessing certain pages, interactions, or actions limiting our solutioning.\n Personas\n If a FigJam exists with user personas, link to it here: \n https://www.figma.com/file/JWoBZzV6MvJRNhgY9EdvwR/CAT-Dispatch-Workflows-June-2023?type=whiteboard&node-id=162%3A2119&t=vOhkEYGkT6dqrax4-1 \n\n User Class \n Description \n Key Goal \n\n OC Navigator\n Individual who fields and assesses incoming calls providing resources or determining if the call requires a crisis dispatch (i.e. CAT Youth, CAT Adult, or PERT).\n Fields and assesses incoming calls\n\n Provides resources and determines if the call requires a crisis dispatch (i.e. CAT Youth, CAT Adult, or PERT)\n\n Updates cases as necessary for accuracy as information is gathered\n\n CAT Clinician\n Licensed, field-level individual who is physically dispatched to a crisis call to provide an official assessment of a client and provide additional resources or referrals as needed.\n Is physically dispatched to a crisis call\n\n Provides an official assessment of a client and additional resources or referrals as needed\n\n Updates case or calls in to OC to provide details to a Navigator who can update on their behalf\n\n CAT Dispatcher\n Individual who physically dispatches appropriate and available clinician to a crisis call from OC Links\n Dispatches appropriate and available clinicians to a crisis call from OC Links\n\n Reviews case and updates for accuracy\n\n Officer of the Day\n CAT Youth specific dispatcher who dispatches appropriate and available clinicians to a crisis call from OC Links\n Dispatches appropriate and available clinicians to a crisis call from OC Links\n\n Reviews case and updates for accuracy\n\n OC Supervisor\n Service chief level user who oversees specific departments or teams related to OC Links and CAT.

Our initial solution must address this pain point and allow us to measure success of our initial solution in order to prioritize a larger effort approach.\n Requirements\n For MVP, we will be releasing a Banner Notification that notifies users if another user is currently in the same case. This solution is less disruptive to current user workflow, creates visibility of users that will likely reduce user collisions and allow for collaboration across program staff in data entry. Although it does not directly mitigate the data overrides from a systemic level, it is an expected feature that was proposed by OC and agreed upon during internal brainstorm sessions as a standard feature along with longer term solutions if required.\n Banner design that can be used on multiple pages that is clear, functional, and easily legible by users\n\n Users must retain the ability to concurrently view a case (eliminates effectivity of a soft lock solution)\n\n Must be accessible across all tabs within an Edit Case screen\n\n Banner notification must update in a reasonable time after a user leaves a case\n\n Nice to have: \n Ability to identify who the other users are within a case are in order to adjust my workflow (i.e. if a Supervisor sees an OC Links Navigator in the case or vice versa, the user can connect with that person in order to coordinate current status, wait until edits are made before entering, etc.)\n\n Out of scope\n Although it is needed for a cohesive user experience in the future and is a potential longer term solution for our multiuser problem, we will not be redesigning key workflows in OC Links or CAT to support a read-only version of a case for MVP. \n Ideas\n Initial Brainstorm Kickoff Notes \n Brainstorm Session #2 \n Outcome: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tv8WTDkPHeTEZx6JqSjFC7Ozun6OlyLFcmSb5aUqhBI/edit#heading=h.mx70i7g37a5z \n Next steps\n Type your action, @someone, and check when complete. \n\n 1 \n incomplete \n Design to create MVP designs on key pages in OC Links \n\n 118 \n incomplete \n Edit Case &rarr; Details Tab \n\n 119 \n incomplete \n Edit Case &rarr; CAT Tab \n\n 2 \n incomplete \n Perform a design review internally and demo with client for approval \n\n 3 \n incomplete \n Consult SA leads to assess LOE and prioritize into future sprints for build \n\n Critical Questions\n Question \n Blocker (y/n)? \n Answer \n Answerer \n Answered on \n\n Is there a way to mitigate multiuser problems between mobile and desktop experiences that have the ability to edit the same data?\n N\n We will implement a banner solution and monitor effectivity through support tickets and user feedback.\n @Phoenix"

This causes inconsistency, inaccuracy, redundancy, inefficiency, which ultimately leads to delayed support for OC residents. \n Constraints \n The following are known timelines, workload, and final approval considerations that will impact the ability to deliver the unified dataset: \n The UAT release of CRP (Crisis Residential Program) on 11/22, with the need for the database by 10/20/23 - Done \n\n As of 11/09/2023, Chorus variables can only support 75 columns (+1 for IDs). The unified database is at this limit, but currently has the following unused columns that may be repurposed for new fields:\n order\n\n featured\n\n featured_order\n\n card_format (would require updating the entry portal to remove this question)\n\n resc_type (unconfirmed, possible duplicate of digital_type)\n\n last_verified_by_ref (unconfirmed, possibly duplicate of last_verified_by)\n\n Dependencies\n The following are items that must be resolved to ensure timely completion of the project. Additional items are called out in the project plan . \n OC Links is referring to its own de-coupled database and will need to be re-hooked to the new unified database. \n Status: \n\n OC Warmline should pull from the new unified database prior to launch at the beginning of December.

Tim said that OC Links doesn't receive referrals. However users should be able to recommend OC Links.\n Additionally, CAT Adult, CAT Youth, and PERT can only be referred to by OC links directly so they shouldn't be available for a CRP for example to send a referral to. I think this means that in the resource database we need to have more metadata that helps guide these nuances.\n For example:\n OC Links should be for recommendations only\n\n CAT programs should be only referrals from OC Lin\n\n I think we can wait until the new year to tackle this potentially, but it's high priority because the risk is that a CRP assumes a referral gets sent to OC Links directly but then doesn't because OC Links doesn't accept referrals\n build not started Purple \n Needs product ticket \n\n 14 \n Name: Treatment type for case history permissions\n Options: \n Substance Use Treatment\n\n HIV Treatment\n\n Type: Multi-select\n New \n Project: \n OCRD-96 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n Product: \n CP-4966 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n build not started Purple - Might need to in sprint 11; will ask Addie on 11/15 \n\n Name: Visibility (not visible to app users)\n Options: \n Public Users\n\n Referrals and Linkages Users\n\n Type: Multi-select\n New\n MVP\n Project: \n OCRD-61 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n Product: \n CP-4840 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n build Done Green \n\n Name: Zip code \n Options: N/A \n Type: Location-based search \n New\n Project: N/A\n Product: \n Sample requirement from Addie: Screenshot below is how this currently works in Chorus.

We will need to expose additional program specific fields for them. \n Note: These are all the fields that are currently in OC Links and Warmline but not in the Navigator.\n\n E. Permissions to add and edit resources \n Note: This section will continue to be updated as governance discussions with the County continue and decisions are made. \n Requirements \n Program-specific notes \n\n R&L Programs will likely need to add a resource post go-live if there's a resource not available in search.\n\n R&L Programs can suggest an edit through the OC Navigator suggest an edit page .\n\n Need to communicate with programs that currently add and edit resources that they will no longer be able to do this in the same way.\n\n OC Links \n Yes. OC Links should continue to be able to edit these fields. Tim and a few others.\n Product discussion: How will we accomplish this? \n\n Warmline \n Yes, but not to county-provided services. To others, yes. They can push a request/note if they find something that is outdated. \n Product discussion: How will we accomplish this? \n\n Questions: \n Does this mean they can add their own resources? Need to ask Sharon. \n\n Bhuvana is supportive of disabling add/edit while data governance discussion/decisions for the unified dataset are made by the County, but would like Warmline to be able to access resources they use beyond OC Links. Her sense is that ~20% of these resources are their \"own\" and not part of the OC Links dataset. \n\n R&L module \n Yes, but only to their own programs.

What is the best approach for OC Links resources?\n Eng maps existing OC Links resource fields to OC Navigator, copies over all OC Links resources and retains their original IDs.\n\n Contractors review both databases and note overlap. Resources on OC Links but not OC Nav are entered to the new database. Overlapping, duplicate and inactive resources are not.\n\n Christy Forte\n Option 2. Engineering will update the existing OC Links case records to point to the new referral resource database IDs (many will be ported over from Navigator). These will have been mapped by the independent contractors.\n\n MCI Sequencing: When will the OC Navigator resource database be copied over to the MCI? \n If this happens before the CRP/Warmline UAT, how will contractors add and edit resources in the Unified Database? Will they need a resource portal?\n If this happens after the CRP/Warmline UAT, do we foresee any issues when changing the table reference from OCN to the Unified Database?\n Christy Forte\n The database can be copied over when asked by the product team. The OC Navigator resource entry portal can continue to be used, as it will be set up to update the unified database. \n This should likely be done before 10/20.\n\n Data Structure for Program-Specific Information: How do we make it such that programs can add information like Internal Notes and Main Contact Details? \n Do we need a separate table, or many more variable fields? If it's a separate table, would it live in the app or on the MCI?\n When will this be ready?\n Christy Forte\n Program specific information will likely live in its own table on the MCI. Columns can be added for each program that needs its own information for Internal Notes or Main Contact Info.\n\n OC Navigator Translations: OC Navigator uses a separate \"app_language_captions\" table to store translated resource details. This table is updated every time a resource is added or edited to the existing OC Navigator database.\n Will this workflow still work if the resource database lives on the MCI?\n , Christy Forte \n \"app_language_captions\" and \"resource_announcements\" will be moved into the MCI.\n\n Resource Data Governance: Who should be allowed to add new resources and edit existing? \n Should this happen in the respective apps (e.g. Warmline staff edits a resource and OC Links resource gets updated). Or should this only be a handful of people who have access to the Resource Entry Portal? \n What about externally operated resources?\n See updates in Requirements Section E.\n\n Program Specific Resources: Is there a way for individual programs to add resources specific to their products without updating the unified database? Is this something that is urgently needed? Does this undermine the initiative, or risk a bunch of redundancies?\n For right now, we are not considering this. \n\n Visible to HCA vs Public: How segmented should visibility of resources be across different apps?\n Example: Is there an HCA resource that will be visible on OC Links, but shouldn't be visible to a CSU user?\n Renaming these options to Public User and R&L User, using multi-select. To reduce complexity, we are keeping this as two options for now.\n\n Payment selection options.\n Is this needed on Internal Tools? Needed for OCN, possibly Warmline, unknown R&L.\n Not needed for R&L as part of requirements. Initial options have been suggested, but may be expanded upon later. We are adding the column for now, but will update as what this field is used for becomes clearer.\n\n Hospitals and Law Enforcement to categories \n Add them as keywords ( to confirm)\n\n Denoting County Contracted/Operated: What field should be used to filter for whether a resource is County Contracted/Operated? \n Examples: Show OC Links Card, Initial Resource Source, Also Appears On, something else?"

The Warmline team shared that they are meeting with them twice a week to continue the implementation process. \n\n Demographics were finalized and shared with the Warmline team.\n We will be having a separate meeting with their team next week to go over the new demographics and also walk them through the template for grooming the participant migration data.\n\n The Warmline would like to have a \"soft launch\" rather than a complete rollout. This approach will focus on ensuring that they have the essential features for success. They will also determine an appropriate time to fully transition the phone number.\n In this instance, a soft launch will also mean that they will continue to use iCarol until they feel that they are ready to make the transition. Once they decide to make the transition over, we will bring over the phone number (including chats). Mike and Mayra to speak with Christy F. and Jamie to investigate any other tasks that need to occur in order to have a complete rollout.\n\n Build for next sprint: \n UAT feedback and backlog items\n\n Demographic fields that do not require additional design support will also be added to this sprint.\n\n Design \n Ellie is currently working on PEI demographics for the Warmline and will then focus her efforts on the following:\n RingCentral\n\n Resource Recommendations\n This is a new requirement from the Warmline. We have received new definitions from the County and we determined that the Warmline primarily makes resource recommendations rather than referrals. Currently, users are able to list a referral (if one is made), but we will be looking to add a section for resource recommendations as well. We plan to have both options be available.\n\n Mike will confirm with the Warmline if this will be needed for the soft launch or if it can be a fast follow.\n\n Spanish & Vietnamese Subcontracts\n The Warmline will be using Abrazar (Spanish subcontractor) and Warner Wellness (Vietnamese subcontractor) for their Spanish and Vietnamese cases. They would like to be able to differentiate between English cases and subcontractor cases.\n\n Training \n Although the Warmline is a County contractor, we will still aim to house the training and help documentation with the other County app documents as well. \n\n UAT \n We have gathered a ton of helpful UAT feedback from their team and are currently adding a lot of their feedback to our product backlog.\n\n Notes/action items\n Mike will confirm with the Warmline if resource recommendations will be needed for the soft launch or if it can be a fast follow.\n\n Decisions\n Type /decision to record the decisions you make in this meeting: \n f8735bf6-ac62-4cfc-b23a-c995ef5a8597 4f807803-03f9-43a0-8800-3b2c38007e8c DECIDED"

Check with OCHCA IT for a current list.\n\n If OCHCA IT is unable to resolve the issue, they may escalate the ticket to Chorus by submitting a support ticket to Chorus Support Center via this link . Chorus will expect the following to have been checked and confirmed is working correctly before submitting to Chorus:\n The user is active in Azure AD.\n\n The user has been assigned to the correct Group(s) in Azure AD."

    "content": "There are many parties involved in any project. For Chorus in particular, here is the list of involved parties and their involvements from the OCHCA perspective.\n OCHCA IT, OC IT, and OC Compliance Teams & Contacts \n Orange County User Provisioning Policy\n Provided by David Castellanos to Chorus on September 5, 2023:\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/197yOIm8A1qxAnNeSVMTr6a82yFwhGgPo/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=115896567208507325556&rtpof=true&sd=true \n NAR Request Workflow\n The whole process starts and ends with a program submitting a NAR (Network Access Request). \n A few notes:\n OCHCA IT does not have its own Azure tenancy. They have a sub-tenancy with OCIT's (County) Azure tenancy. So when we are talking about Azure AD, we are referring to the County Azure AD.\n\n All contractor accounts are created in MIM (Microsoft Identity Management) and synced up to Azure AD .\n\n The County HR team is not involved in the OCHCA IT's contractor provisioning and de-provisioning process.\n\n Provisioning County Employed Users (HCA Users)\n The Program will submit a NAR to request a new user (or contractor) through an ISM (IT Service Management) ticketing system managed by the OCHCA IT service desk.\n\n The ticket will be processed by the OCHCA IT provisioning team based on the predefined roles from The Program (On-Premise Azure AD Groups which eventually sync up to Azure AD Group).\n\n The County HR provisioning team will pre-create the user account in MIM with the appropriate roles. At the same time, the County HR \" HART \" system (the employees management system) will also create the new employee account. \n\n Once MIM and HART sync up through the MIM sync process, the account will be created in both OCHCA IT Azure AD and the County Azure AD.\n\n De-provisioning County Employed Users (HCA Users)\n The Program will submit a NAR to request de-provisioning of a user (or contractor) through an ISM ticketing system managed by the OCHCA IT service desk.\n\n The OCHCA IT provisioning team will process the termination of the user's account in MIM .\n (The user will not be able to gain any access from OCHCA IT resources. The account will be disabled, but not deleted, in OCHCA IT Azure AD.)\n\n County HR will remove the user from the HART system.\n\n After HART and MIM sync up, the user's account will permanently be removed from both OCHCA IT AD and County Azure AD.\n\n Contractor Provisioning Options\n B2B – Current Method in Use and Confirmed by Orange County on 9/14/23\n The OCHCA IT sysadmin team (Phong's team) will work with OCIT to create a script to invite a contractor's email (including personal emails) to join the County Azure AD. \n\n The contractor will go though an authentication process to create their own identity, including the setup of MFA. \n\n Once registered, OCHCA IT will assign the contractor with a specific role(s) to a pre-defined Azure AD Group. The available Azure AD Groups are defined by the OC program staff and the Chorus team and implemented by the OCHCA IT team.\n\n FIM (Federate Identity Management) – Method Currently Unavailable \n This requires all contractors/providers to belong to a trusted federation like Okta, AWS, Amazon, Google, Facebook, AOL, Yahoo, etc. Chorus would need to build the support for each of these trusted sources or integrate with a product like Auth0 . Both of these options at this time are unavailable. \n Manually Create in a User in MIM\n Our OCHCA IT provisioning team will have to manually create these accounts for contractors and use the MIM sync process to sync it up to the County Azure AD.\n OCIT Involvement\n OCIT is the Azure AD integration provider. We only need them to create Azure AD Enterprise Applications and provide OIDC authentication (instead of SAML) as this is modern best practice. We will also need to work with them for the onboarding process for contractors either B2B. (They are not involved in the OCHCA IT user provisioning process.)"

All users with access to this designated folder will have access to all files available in this folder.\n\n A download log may be provided upon request to monitor which users are downloading which files. \n\n The list of users should be kept at an absolute minimum for best security practices.\n\n The client-approved users will be granted per-user access that is not to be shared. These users must provide an SSH key from the device they plan to use for accessing the data exports.\n\n New User Requests\n Prerequisite Requirements : OC employees will need to work with OCHCA IT to: \n Generate an SSH key\n\n Identify and/or install an approved SFTP client.\n\n Once these are available, they may proceed with their request. \n OC program staff submits a NAR to OCHCA IT with the following information:\n Requester's name\n\n Requester's email\n\n Requester's title\n\n Date of request\n\n New user's name\n\n New users's title\n\n New user's SSH key\n OCHCA IT will need to assist the approved user with generating this SSH key.\n\n OCHCA IT will need to identify and/or install an approved SFTP client on this user's device.\n\n List of data export files the new user plans to access\n\n OCHCA IT approves the request and sends a Zendesk support@chorus-ochcahelpcenter.zendesk.com ticket with the same information to Chorus. \n\n Chorus processes the request.\n\n A Chorus representative will then schedule a screenshare session with the new user to confirm their SFTP connection is successful using the SFTP client recommended by OCHCA IT.\n\n Chorus notifies OCHCA IT the Zendesk ticket is resolved.\n\n OCHCA IT notifies program staff the NAR ticket is resolved.\n\n User Removal Requests\n OC program staff submits a NAR to OCHCA IT requesting a user be removed.\n\n OCHCA IT approves the request and sends a Zendesk support@chorus-ochcahelpcenter.zendesk.com ticket with the same information to Chorus. \n\n Chorus processes the request and notifies OCHCA IT the Zendesk ticket is resolved.\n\n OCHCA IT notifies program staff the NAR ticket is resolved."

Do we need to list all of these people, and if so, how do we need to approach this?\n Ex: https://www.ochealthcareagency.com/mhp/38652-bryson-carrie-sudrc-laguna-hills \n\n Terminology\n Helpful resource &rarr; OC Amendment 3 Common Terms and Definitions \n Term \n Definition \n\n Resource \n A resource is a form of support available for OC residents to find and connect with assistance in different areas of their lives, including health, wellbeing and other supportive services. In the OC Navigator, there are two types of resources and this organization impacts how the information is organized and presented to site visitors: \n Services: Involve interacting with an organization, service provider, or another human being. These may require a referral or a recommendation. \n Examples: Hospitals, food banks, telehealth providers, and hotlines. \n\n Online (digital): Can be accessed online, anytime, and do not require a referral or recommendation. \n Examples: PDF toolkits, articles, and websites that focus on educating. \n\n County-operated or County-contracted Programs \n These are OC HCA-provided resources that include mental wellness, substance use, housing, supportive employment programs. The accuracy of this information is under higher scrutiny because they receive state funding and are required to list additional details like NPI number, ADA compliance and license numbers. \n Examples: Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT), and Collaborative Courts. \n\n Resources not overseen by OC HCA include other government programs like OCTA or private organizations like the AARP or the Salvation Army.\n\n Referral Only Program \n Resources where community members must be referred by a program or provider to receive supportive services. These programs may not be visible to the general public.\n\n Self-Referral \n Resources where community members are able to call and refer themselves for supportive services, without assistance from another program or provider.\n\n Referral \n When a client is given a recommendation in writing to a specific service provider for care and treatment.\n\n Recommendation \n The process of providing a participant with one or more suggested resources, without plans and/or an ability to follow up on linkage status.\n\n Linkage \n Client is admitted to or participates at least once in the treatment to which they were referred. \n\n Closed Loop Referral \n Referring and receiving providers are able to track the status of a referral and confirm client status between both providers.\n\n Referrals and Linkages Module \n A system of features within Chorus products that allows apps to receive, track, manage and send referrals to other apps.\n The current list of OC products set to use this module (as of 8/22/2023) is: CRP, O&E Expansion, CSU, CAT, IHCS and OC Links\n\n 💿 Dataset Fields \n Field \n Definition and example \n\n Category \n An organizational field that splits up resources by the type of support provided. OC Navigator has 11 categories that allow for multi-select. OC Links has 13 options that are single select.\n Example: Mental wellness \n\n Subcategory \n A proposed additional organizational field within a category.\n Example: Under the money category, housing fees. \n\n Resource Type \n Currently, this field describes where a resource is classes in the existing, outdated Behavioral Health Systems (BHS) structure in OC Links, Warmline, others? OC HCA has expressed an interest in revamping the options for this field. It is currently unclear if they would like to keep record of this outdated BHS structure in the database.\n Example: \n\n Search Hint \n OC Navigator metadata assigned to resources that gets referenced by search to populate results. Created based on the resource name, description, eligibility, language, categories, hours, and keywords. \n Example: \n\n Keyword \n Pre-defined groupings of search hints created with subject matter experts (SMEs). These are assigned by staff who add and edit resources through the Resource Entry Portal and OC Navigator site visitors can view them on the resource detail page, under \"Eligibility.\"\n Example: A resource tagged with \"autism\" will be assigned the search hints \"autism, autism spectrum, aspergers, is my child autistic, testing for autism\"."

O&E Mobile serves the needs of the field staff so that they can receive notifications of assignments, track their progress on a case, and document case outcomes.\n Outreach & Engagement Universal Activity Form (UAF) Survey\n The O&E UAF is a form that the O&E outreach staff uses to take a census of homeless encampments in the county.\n OC Navigator\n The OC Navigator is a resource navigation website that helps community members and providers find mental health and social services that can address their needs. Various features support users' journey to care: a social needs questionnaire identifies what a user may need and recommends resources; community-curated resource guides provide actionable steps and resources for specific topics; and users can connect to programs with contact information that is regularly updated.\n Explanation of Chorus Roles\n Each Chorus role gives a user access to a certain app, and allows for certain permissions within that app. See table below for details.\n Explanation of the Permissions Each Role Provides\n OC Links (including CAT Dispatch, CSU Bed Board, O&E, and O&E UAF Survey)\n Features/Groups \n Administrators \n OC Links Navigators \n CSU Users \n Download Data \n O&E Supervisors \n O&E Staff \n\n Create/View/Edit Cases\n x\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Clients\n x\n x\n\n Merge Client Records\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Resources\n x\n x\n\n Participate in client-initiated Chats\n x\n x\n\n View Dispatch Board\n x\n x\n\n View Staff Schedule\n x\n x\n\n Create/Edit/View Staff Schedule\n x\n\n View Staff\n x\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit OC Links Staff\n x\n\n Edit own profile\n x\n x\n x\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Announcements\n x\n\n View Announcements\n x\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Follow Ups\n x\n x\n\n View App Reports\n x\n\n Edit Dropdown Contents\n x\n\n Export Data from Application\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Bed Board Referral\n x\n\n View Bed Board Statistics for all CSUs\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit UAF Surveys\n x\n\n View/Edit O&E Requests\n x\n\n View O&E Statistics\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit O&E Staff\n x\n\n OC Navigator\n Features/Group \n OC Admin \n Staff \n OC Navigator App \n\n Create/View/Edit Users\n x\n x\n x\n\n Create/View/Edit Resources\n x\n x\n x\n\n View Reports\n x\n x"

    "content": "Background\n Prior to engaging with Chorus, Warmline set up a \"CRM\" system with iCarol. As of Fall 2023, Chorus intends to replace iCarol as that \"CRM\" system for housing all participant information instead. The provided proposal below outlines iCarol's proposed integration strategy with Nice, a partner of RingCentral for the product Warmline is using for their call system.\n Information Shared with Warmline from iCarol\n I have been assigned to help you setup up Telephony Integration in your system. While we can certainly meet to help clarify any questions you may have after you have reviewed this ticket, Telephony Integration is actually very straight forward. Please read the contents of this ticket carefully and reply to the action items outlined below.\n Before we go too much further into the setup details, I'd like to start by telling you how telephony integration works.\n Telephony Integration works by your Telephony Provider sending a specific URL (that I will provide below) populated with certain values gathered from the incoming phone call. Your Telephony Provider will then send that URL to the desk of the agent routed an incoming call, where your agent will then be presented with a new iCarol Contact Report Form open on their screen and that form is populated with those values gathered from the incoming call. At that point your agent would work the call as normal and then would submit the iCarol Contact Report Form.\n In order for a value to populate onto the iCarol Contact Report Form, that information that has to be gathered from the actual incoming call by your Telephony system before being routed to the agent. Most commonly these values are things like Phone Number from Caller ID, Incoming Phone Line that was called, and any keypress options setup by your Telephony System, such as \"for English Press 1\" or \"Please key in your 5 digit zip code\". \n Each of these are VALUES that can then populate onto the iCarol Contact Report Form. How they get into the form is through the URL string.\n Please carefully review each of the following Action Items and reply to this ticket with your updated information and any questions you may have. \n Action Items:\n Consider what other pieces of information you gather through your telephone system about a call that you would like to populate onto the Contact Report Form. For instance, if you want \"Incoming Line\" that was rang to populate onto the form, where on your Contact Report Form would that information go? Most commonly you will have (or will need to add) a drop down list on your form that is for \"Incoming Line\" - so that when a new form opens up, the \"Incoming Line\" question is already selected. \n\n Review the linked Telephony Integration Knowledge Base Article and attached Telephony Document to further understand what other \"Standard Fields\" can populate onto an iCarol Contact Report Form through this process. \n\n For now you will see in the URL string below that I have included \"ani=VALUE\" When VALUE is replaced with a phone number from caller ID. That Phone Number will be entered onto the Contact Report Form. Again consider what other VALUES from a call that could be populated into the Contact Report Form and reply to this ticket with other items you would like included . I will add that to your URL string and send that back to you for you to forward onto your provider.\n\n Please reply to this ticket with the name of your Telephony Provider \n\n If you use caller Profiles, do you want to automatically populate a caller profile onto a new form when the caller ID matches the phone number of Profile in your iCarol system?\n\n Template URL to give to your Telephony Provider- once we set up the feature\n Below is the template URL that you need to provide to your Telephony Provider, where they replace VALUE with the phone number from the caller ID.\n https://services.icarol.com/telephony.asmx/GetCallReport?reportVer=#####&ani=VALUE \n iCarol Telephony Integration\n October 13, 2021"

Since CRPs are residential stays, \"Linkage\" has been defined as when the client is admitted to the service\n\n Closed Loop Referral \n Referring and receiving providers are able to track the status of a referral and confirm client status between both providers\n\n Problem statement\n The focus of this initiative is aimed at OC Links Navigators, CAT Clinicians, and associated management users, targeting the following challenges:\n The current referral process between OC Programs is inefficient and relies on fax, phone calls and emails. This results in communication gaps and delays in placing individuals in suitable programs\n\n There is a lack of visibility into how many referrals are successfully accepted and linked across the county\n\n Objective\n Create a system that allows OC Links and CAT Clinicians to receive, manage, and send referrals to other OC programs (both county contracted and county operated). This includes the ability to: \n Receive and manage incoming referrals\n\n Send and track outgoing referrals\n\n Broader Context\n OC Links and CAT will be the 2nd and 3rd programs to include the Referrals & Linkages (R&L) module (a module designed to send and receive referrals digitally across the county). CRP is the first program\n As additional programs are onboarded onto the R&L module, OC Links and CAT will be able to digitally send and receive more referrals through Chorus \n\n In the short term, they will only be able to digitally send and receive referrals to CRPs and will have to manually send referrals in other ways\n\n Sharon would like the initial focus of R&L to be on the crisis system of care which includes: \n CRPs (new system) - 1st R&L program \n\n CAT - 2nd R&L program (already built, but need to add R&L module)\n\n OC Links - 3rd R&L program (already built, but need to add R&L module)\n\n CSUs - 4th R&L program (already built, but will need to be updated to be consistent with the CRP experience including adding the R&L module)\n\n IHCS (new system) \n\n O&E (new mobile dispatch system) - Led in a separate initiative by JJ that will include the R&L module to reduce any retrofits down the road\n\n Personas\n OC Links Service Chief (Tim) \n Goals: Tim wants his Navigators to be able to help their clients and be able to document all necessary information frictionlessly in Chorus\n\n Motivations: Tim cares about understanding at a high-level how many referrals that his Navigators make are being accepted and linked\n\n Frustrations: Tim is frustrated that Chorus can be slow both to update and in performance. He also gets frustrated when things don't work the way he expects them to\n\n OC Links Navigator (Asita) \n Goals: Asita wants to be able to care for her client\n\n Motivations: Asita really wants to help clients find ongoing care after their call to OC Links\n\n Frustrations: Asita is frustrated when she has to spend a lot of time on administrative tasks and can't quickly find information that could help her client\n\n CAT Clinician (Joe) \n Goals: Joe wants to very quickly get to the client in the field that is experiencing a crisis and help them get the care they need\n\n Motivations: Joe wants to be able to help clients find ongoing care to help deal with their crisis and mental health\n\n Frustrations: Joe is frustrated with all the documentation that he has to do\n\n Client at OC Links that is referred to CAT - note: clients will not have access to the R&L Module in the short term (Richard) \n Goals: Richard wants to get help with his mental health crisis so he calls into OC Links\n\n Motivations: Richard wants to get help with his immediate crisis and be able to have a plan of action after his interaction with CAT\n\n Frustrations: Richard is frustrated by having to retell his story to different programs in the county. He's also frustrated that the process takes such a long time\n\n Functional Workflow - Future state\n For most up to date and complete functional workflows please see figma: https://www.figma.com/file/ZehsPRBCvUMmu5b1hqFtXS/Crisis-R%26L-Audit?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=aAV7LKX2EHur58dq-1 \n Critical User Journeys & Requirements\n See Q4 Product Plan for high-level requirements\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gXk4ybpvtzTAQ8TLvD9MuQJhgkOXULGm_-SKvkQyF8/edit \n Dependencies\n Data Type \n Action \n Status \n\n Client \n Client History - Determine the minimum viable history that all programs will be able to view\n Blocker : IT & Compliance sign off required before turning on automated referrals among OC apps\n Required Milestone Meetings: \n Requirements meeting with Sharon & Tim ( Sarah to coordinate scheduling) \n\n OC IT, Compliance, and Sharon for MHP & DMC client data sharing requirements is being rescheduled. \n\n Client data - Updated client demographic field information to be more consistent with PIF\n Starting build\n\n Chorus Master Client Index Development and Implementation - \n Chorus Master Client Index (MCI) will be configured within its own Chorus app, allowing program apps the ability to read and write client data and history to a single source of truth\n\n New apps (CRP) will have the option to be built and connected to the MCI during development.

Chorus is one platform among many that OC needs to sync data with. \n\n What do we expect to accomplish? \n We aim to create a mechanism whereby Chorus can connect to Orange County's Cerner Cloud EHR (to start), with the capacity to add more of their inherited EHRs over time using the Redox engine.\n\n Why is it important? \n Orange County has patient records across a multitude of providers. Providing an integration with Chorus and Cerner Cloud EHR is another step in overall record consolidation and improved record management.\n\n Chorus team \n R esponsible \n Designer: \n\n Engineer / SA(s): TBD\n\n A ccountable\n Product Manager: \n\n C onsulted: \n I nformed: \n\n Jira epics \n CHORUS-5252 a9d3eb4c-c63a-3c77-864c-b5dd8664a020 System JIRA \n\n Figma file \n https://www.figma.com/file/Q3eLUviuK47uiT7pmMqrGM/%5BWIP%5D-Redox-workflows?type=design&node-id=684%3A896&mode=design&t=FbsDL0n16aB8gNo7-1 \n https://www.figma.com/file/rVjSBy7KEWLQb13yTpAg8w/Redox-Workflows?type=design&node-id=127%3A54&mode=design&t=OeUqcmKlzz4OdkF2-1 \n\n Client impacts \n OC Master Client Index (MCI)\n\n OC Links\n\n OC PEI\n\n OC Warmline\n\n OC CRP\n\n Chorus impacts \n\n Client deadline \n Q1 2024\n\n Terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n EHR\n Electronic health record – a systematized collection of data. Think about it like a database of patients and things that concern them (schedules, medications, procedures, providers, etc.).\n\n IRIS\n The on-premises version of the OC Cerner EHR. As of Q1 2024 this will be replaced by the Cerner Cloud EHR (technically remote hosted). \n\n Cerner Cloud\n The Orange County EHR what will be available in Q1 of 2024.\n\n Redox\n A tool that helps us make federated EHR connections. Chorus connects to Redox and then Redox can make all the EHR connections we need. https://www.redoxengine.com/ \n\n MRN\n Medical Record Number. A medical record number (MRN) is a unique identifier assigned to a patient in an electronic health record (EHR), practice management, or healthcare IT system. The MRN is used to keep track of medical history, diagnoses, treatments, and other important information related to patient care.\n\n FHIR\n Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. The FHIR standard defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different computer systems regardless of how it is stored in those systems.

This will require the ability to both read and write between the HCA EDW and Contractor digital solutions.\n\n Explore integration with OC systems for client data that are not entered into a HCA EHR (e.g., resource referrals)\n\n [See also https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_5rfmkJA68PHgFU3TNPlxaq2PwimetcPFiP7TEle1Q/edit page 17 .]\n Broader Context\n See Redox to Chorus Platform Integration for Connecting to EHRs PRD for more information.\n Key User Stories\n As an (authorized) author, I want to map applicable Chorus data to applicable Cerner Cloud EHR data.\n\n As a client or author, if I update patient data in Chorus, I want that data also updated in my Cerner Cloud record.\n\n As an author, if patient data is updated in the EHR, I want that data also updated in Chorus.\n\n As a data owner, I want to see what Chorus apps have access to certain fields in the EHR. \n\n Success metrics\n Goal Type \n Goal \n Metric \n\n Business\n Chorus can integrate with the Cerner Cloud EHR.\n Patient information more accurate, easier to maintain, and synced across different systems.\n\n Constraints\n Currently, the Orange County Cerner Cloud system is actively being built and existing records from the IRIS Cerner (an onprem server) are being migrated. The target completion date by Orange County is Q1 2024.\n\n Chorus will only be mapping data that exists at the time Cerner Cloud becomes available.\n\n As soon as it's available, Orange County will provide Chorus with Cerner Cloud Integrations or Cerner Cloud UAT EHR access to begin connection efforts.\n\n Chorus must pass Cerner certifications for integration.\n\n Our solution must adhere to Security, Privacy, and Compliance rules, standards, and best practices.\n\n Chorus will only sync data to Cerner Cloud that is supported by the 5 predetermined Data Models from Redox, or for which a FHIR Extension exists: \n https://developer.redoxengine.com/data-models/PatientAdmin.html \n\n https://developer.redoxengine.com/data-models/PatientSearch.html \n\n https://developer.redoxengine.com/data-models/Referral.html \n\n https://developer.redoxengine.com/data-models/Notes.html \n\n https://developer.redoxengine.com/data-models/Scheduling.html \n\n Orange County and Chorus will need to identify a system for Patient Matching.\n In scope (but needs discovery) : Leverage the existing OC patient matching solution. \n MRNs will backfill as patient records are updated in the EHR.\n\n Will involve a level of data migration effort.\n\n Out of scope : Use a tool like Verato to handle patient matching. (We would like to pitch this investment once we have more research.) \n\n Requirements\n Orange County will collaborate with the Chorus team to provide an accurate data mapping of fields in Chorus with fields in the Cerner Cloud EHR. This mapping will outline the fields that should:\n Sync between the two systems.\n\n Be read, write, or both.\n\n Data will sync in real time. \n\n Milestones\n Milestone 1: MVP\n Milestone 2: \n Milestone 3: \n\n Release Blockers\n Must have feature 1 \n\n Must have feature 2 \n\n Release Blockers:\n Ability to send data to custom fields in Cerner?\n\n Release Blockers: \n Ability to send/receive Scheduling-related data.\n\n Should have\n Desired feature 1 \n\n Desired feature 2 \n\n Should have:\n Should have:\n\n Nice to have\n Bonus feature 1 \n\n Bonus feature 2 \n\n Nice to have:\n Nice to have:\n\n Out of scope\n Scheduling . Chorus will not provide any data syncing for Scheduling needs until a Chorus app (i.e. OC module) exists with this functionality with clearly defined scope. (We anticipate such a project will not be available until after Q1 2024.) The only scope known to date: \n Ability to schedule appointments from Chorus apps into providers.\n\n They will need the ability to read in the EHR schedule. A potential workaround for writing back could be for the user to call to officially schedule. We would need to confirm this viability of this approach.\n\n Orange County shared they would like for users to schedule an appointment in clinics using the IRIS EHR. This would be part of the outgoing referral workflow for the Referrals & Linkages app .\n\n Advanced Patient Matching . At this time, Verato, an advanced patient matching tool and partner company to Redox, is excluded from this scope of work. Chorus will present research demonstrating the pros and cons to Orange County to make an educated decision whether or not this should be included in the initial scope of work. Until this, this is expressly excluded.\n\n Files\n Description \n Author \n Link \n\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fe2ZV8k4i0mVFu6UnENabaJgKarfcvyl6baOjo7J2rA/edit#gid=1758898685 \n\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17t9wEZwEGe8io4uFtEyjuiyyfly-14ih3HQXg8gDFco/edit#gid=0 \n\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/178TQAbo-Nu9xqz-N0lzSLtn4Ij9rNI9SQRCn1rGiZJU/edit#gid=429647645 \n\n OC Navigator Variables (coming soon)\n\n OC CRP (coming soon)\n\n MCI (coming soon)\n\n Critical Questions\n Question \n Blocker (y/n)? \n Answer \n Answerer \n Answered on \n\n How does Orange County want to address patient matching between Chorus and Cerner Cloud? \n In scope: Create an MRN field in Chorus and create a rudimentary process to match those records 1:1.\n\n Out of scope: Use an advanced tool like Verato for Patient Matching.

This person can also be the respondent themselves.\n\n Respondent \n The person who needs more intensive care. There are basic eligibility criteria this person must meet. \n\n Hearing \n A court hearing where the petitioner and respondent answers questions from the CARE Court team, including OC judges, so they can determine eligibility and progress in the CARE Court system \n\n Problem statement\n The focus of this initiative is to support a brand new process undertaken by OC HCA CARE Court staff, including MHRS representatives in the hearings and MHRS case management staff that includes:\n a new way to intake CARE Act clients \n\n a way track outreach conducted by MHRS staff to engage the respondent/client\n\n Currently, staff are using a spreadsheet to track this data. \n Objective\n Create a system that allows CARE Court staff to intake new clients with PEI PIF fields and track staff outreach efforts. This includes the ability to: \n Intake new clients with PEI PIF fields and additional fields related to the Court petition\n\n Track outreach and engagement efforts such as time stamps and notes related to each outreach\n\n In future iterations, this system would be connected to the larger Referral and Linkages system to refer clients to services in MHRS.\n Broader Context\n CARE Act was implemented October 2, 2023. CARE Act is a new process in California to help persons with untreated schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders to provide them with behavioral health and other essential resources and services. OC is one of the first counties to implement the CARE Act.\n\n When a Petitioner submits a petition (via drop-in, mail, or online), an OC Courts Judge will review the petition and determine if the Respondent's needs meet the basic requirements of the CARE Act. \n A petition is a packet of documents that includes the petition, a Mental Health Declaration, and possibly other needed documents. \n\n If the Respondent meets the criteria, the Judge will assign HCA to complete a report and will appoint a Public Defender to represent the Respondent. \n\n Once HCA has completed the report, the Judge reviews the report and determines whether to move forward to develop a care plan. \n\n The care plan for a Respondent must be approved and ordered by the Court. The plan is subject to Court modification before approval.\n\n See figures below for the OC process. This flowchart was created by CARE Court staff. Source deck here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19wwq9tu49StagZSOtIWYSIfbhC22MDPb/edit#slide=id.p1 \n Visit the official website for more information: https://www.courts.ca.gov/48654.htm \n Personas\n MHRS CARE Court Staff \n Goals: Intake and track client throughout CARE Court process\n\n Motivations: I want an organized and easy way to intake clients, find their file and update their status for the year they are participating in CARE court\n\n Frustrations: I'm using a spreadsheet and it's too easy for clients to fall through the cracks or for me to forget to follow up\n\n Functional Workflow - Future state\n Critical User Journeys & Requirements\n Design \n Align with new OC branding (O&E, CRP etc)\n\n Product \n Client Dashboard\n Create New Petition (redirect to client intake)\n\n Client Search\n Case number, first name, last name\n\n Client Intake\n CARE Court-specific fields\n\n PIF\n\n Monthly CARE Status Survey\n CARE Court-specific fields\n\n Data \n Clients will be stored in MCI\n\n CARE Court data will be kept in separate table (similar to the way O&E is structured)\n\n Out of Scope\n\n Files\n https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gqkvDoB8NALNhk3J2oKdWNgj_S9sTbeW \n Open Questions \n Question \n Answer \n Team to ask"

This causes clients to get lost in the system without receiving care.\n\n Referrals require providers to send each other multiple back and forth communications , taking time away from client care.\n\n Delayed treatment per client results also results in higher costs related to poor clinical outcomes and readmissions \n\n Personas\n Client (Richard) \n Goals: Richard wants to work on his mental health by staying at Phoenix House\n\n Clinicians (Leon) \n Goals: Leon wants to be able to care for his client and help clients find ongoing care after their stay at Phoenix House\n\n Intake Coordinators (Cindy) \n Goals: Cindy wants to ensures that incoming referrals for SUD services are easily manageable\n\n Authorization team (ART) service chief (Glenn) \n Goals: Glenn wants to ensure that all requests to authorize referrals are done quickly but also accurately.\n\n Before we begin: a note on terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC-ODS) \n The Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC-ODS) provides a continuum of care modeled after the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services, enables more local control and accountability, provides greater administrative oversight, creates utilization controls to improve care and efficient use of resources, implements evidenced based practices in SUD treatment, and coordinates with other systems of care.\n Source: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/Drug-Medi-Cal-Organized-Delivery-System.aspx \n\n American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) \n Established in 1954, ASAM is a distinguished medical society that encompasses more than 7,500 physicians, clinicians, and related professionals who specialize in addiction medicine. DMC-ODS is modeled after ASAM Criteria for SUD services\n The ASAM Criteria Assessment Interview Guide from DHCS \n\n Bed Board (aka Bed Availability Board) \n Shows availability at different programs, so that referrers (e.g., Police, CAT Team, etc.) know if they can refer a client to a program\n\n Referral \n When a client is given a recommendation in writing to a specific service provider for care and treatment\n\n Linkage \n Client participates at least once in the treatment to which they were referred. Since CRPs are residential stays, \"Linkage\" has been defined as when the client is admitted to the service\n\n Closed Loop Referral \n Referring and receiving providers are able to track the status of a referral and confirm client status between both providers\n\n Authorization for Residential Treatment (ART) \n BHS staff responsible for authorizing residential treatment. ART team staff are healthcare professionals with appropriate clinical expertise in treating the beneficiary's/client's condition or disease\n\n Authorization \n The approval process for DMC-ODS services prior to the submission of a DMC-ODS claim\n\n Withdrawal Management \n Services are offered in residential, non-institutional, non-medical withdrawal management programs that utilize a social model detox system, for a maximum of seven (7) days to help beneficiaries during the non-acute detoxification process. Acute withdrawal management services are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Steps down to SUD residential where they stay for 30 days, from residential treatment go to outpatient services for as long as they need\n\n Residential Treatment \n Residential treatment substance use and/or co-occurring mental health treatment program for up to 90 days. Program addresses behaviors and emotions behind addiction. Treatment includes individual therapy, group therapy, and education about addiction. It is a non-institutional, 24-hour non-medical, short-term residential program that provides rehabilitation services when determined as medically necessary. Residential services require prior authorization by the County Plan. Each authorization for residential services can be for a maximum of 90 days for adults and 30 days for youth. Only two authorizations for residential services are allowed in a one-year-period.\n\n Recovery Residence \n The Outpatient Recovery program is designed for adults ages 18 and older who are living with a serious mental illness and possible co-occurring substance use disorder. The program is operated at multiple locations throughout the county, with County-contracted locations referred to as Recovery Centers and County-operated locations referred to as Recovery Clinics. Individuals are referred to the program by Plan Coordinators in the Adult and Older Adult Behavioral Health (AOABH) Outpatient Clinics after all emergent mental health issues have resolved. This typically occurs within the first 3 to 6 months of being opened in an AOABH clinic. Individuals are referred to the contracted Recovery Centers after they have been in the AOABH outpatient system of care for one year and have remained out of the hospital or jail, are stable on their medication regimen and have consistently attended their appointments.\n\n 42 CFR Part 2\n Federal regulation 42 CFR Part 2 requires providers to obtain patient consent before sharing information about treatment for substance use disorders with other providers.\n\n Goals\n Ensure timely access to care for SUD services to clients\n\n Reduce the administrative burden related to phone calls and data entry to support referrals\n\n note EQRO metrics to define timely access to services\n SUD Residential/Outpatient: 10 days\n\n SUD Withdrawal Management: 48 hours\n\n EQRO metrics to define timely access to services\n SUD Residential/Outpatient: 10 days\n\n SUD Withdrawal Management: 48 hours\n\n Success metrics\n Goal \n Metric \n\n Ensure timely access to care for SUD services to clients\n Time from referral request to appointment offered \n\n Time from referral request to appointment accepted\n\n Time from referral request to linkage\n\n No show rate\n\n Vacancy rate\n\n Reduce the administrative burden related to phone calls and data entry to support referrals\n Reduce # of emails sent between SUD programs\n\n Removal of excel bedboard tracking sheets\n\n Staff satisfaction \n\n User Research Synthesis\n UXR efforts\n 1 - In person shadowing session with the ART team\n\n 1 - Referrals and Linkages Workshop with SUD and Housing (OC kickoff)\n\n 2 - Deep Dive interview sessions with the ART team on residential treatment and residential recovery workflows\n\n 3 - Deep Dive Interview Sessions with RT and RR providers (upcoming) \n\n Notable Quotes\n \"Each provider emails an excel sheet every morning showing their bed availability.

For each referral into SUD services, an ATD must be filled out which specifies which organizations will receive, disclose, and exchange information. \n\n The ART ATD specifies a list of providers that will be able to receive information, but it's possible that the client might remove a few from the list.\n\n Feature Priorities\n Must Have Features \n Feature \n Justification \n\n Referral Dashboards\n Users need a view to see incoming referrals to determine which they need to address\n\n Creating and forwarding new referrals\n ART team and Providers need the ability to create new referrals when requested from referral sources and send to different groups \n\n Attaching documents to referrals\n Attachments are needed to support first iteration of ATD's and ASAM's\n\n Live bedboard availability and bed assignment\n Main cause of administrative task overload is constant communication of excel sheets. A live bed availability bedboard significantly reduces administrative work.\n\n Compliance to ATD permissions (non-digitized)\n Referrals need to be only viewable by programs listed in the signed ATD. \n\n Placement lists\n ART team needs a method to track which clients are approved for treatment and simply need a bed assigned.\n\n Live Status Tracking\n Users need to see the history of the referral, including changes to status, notes from other providers, and linkage information.\n\n Should Have Features \n Feature \n Justification \n\n Email and SMS Notifications\n Allows programs to quickly respond to incoming referrals sent to their dashboard. Referrals can be supported without notifications but this requires users to view dashboard multiple times within a day.\n\n Edit Client/Referral \n Allows users to keep and client and referral data up-to-date if there are any changes\n\n Nice to Have Features \n Feature \n Justification \n\n Activity Log\n Detailed list of changes made to referrals and referral fields in a historical view. LOE is high and status tracking should ensure all mandatory activities are captured.\n\n Print\n Allows users to have referrals documented outside of Chorus. Not crucial to current workflows found in UXR.\n\n Live/Digitized TAR review updates\n Pending UXR research \n\n Future Roadmap (currently out of scope for initial launch)\n Feature \n Justification \n\n Integrated referrals and bedboards viewable directly on OC links, O&E, CAT, CRP/CSU\n Certain live OC apps (CRP's specifically) commonly send referrals to SUD. However, this workflow can be supported via manual referral creations from the SUD programs for the time being. High risk associated with sensitive information being sent from and to SUD clinics due to 42 CFR regulations. \n\n Future bedboard projections/availability \n UXR revealed that current referral and bed management workflows do not account for future bedboard projections. Not needed for current launch, but would be great addition after initial launch to offer appointments/intake dates earlier.\n\n Administrative/supervisor views\n Reports on referral tracking analytics as well as overview screens for multiple programs. Risk associated with sensitive information due to 42 CFR regulations. Feature is not needed to support initial workflow digitization.\n\n Guest portal\n Multiple referral sources into SUD programs are not slated to use Chorus. Provision of a guest portal allows the ART team to reduce the amount of referrals to generate on Chorus. Risk associated here with sensitive 42 CFR regulations as well as ambiguity regarding adoption of a guest portal. \n\n Completely digitized ATD \n UXR revealed that OC does not deal with client requests for custom ATD permissions (IE: asking that only certain clinics receive information). Current practice is to sign off ATD which allows all programs to have access regardless of destination. High LOE from dev team as well.\n\n Next Steps\n Utilize UXR sessions to start collaborative design process with stakeholders utilizing design prototypes\n\n Create detailed plans for usability tests (can we fit design prototypes, alpha testing, beta testing, AND UAT before release)\n\n Continue continuous UXR process throughout stakeholder interviews\n\n Files\n Relevant Documents:\n SUD Linkage Form https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjXKx8POEnxPBrCE9ELF3IcpknKC9J8j/view?usp=sharing \n\n Brief SUD LOC form: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CaUP3ZRKjvo9jO2TGzMKKzRb1jMLsHEg/view?usp=sharing \n\n ART ATD form https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kXkOgWjOSjVvhV7XtiWkaPdLfICtU8Ch/view?usp=sharing \n\n Drive with all other documents: \n\n Critical User Journeys & Requirements\n https://www.figma.com/board/z7sujV1UzeUaXk05KjHbL6/SUD-Residential-Treatment-and-Recovery-Residence-Documentation?node-id=38-155&t=JDQEVlnb0WW8A5ei-4 \n\n Dependencies & Questions\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SNg_tK3YtBdoVkLO7TJhd9NSVOo9i8E3KV72PPoMlDE/edit#heading=h.8orveys5vviv \n\n Client List & Permissions \n Can we have one client list across all SUD programs?\n\n Can we have one client list across all MHRS Programs & SUD Programs?\n Which programs (both county operated and county contracted) from MHRS are allowed to see SUD clients? Which programs from MHRS are allowed to see SUD history?\n\n How much information should SUD programs be able to see from other SUD Programs and from MHRS programs?\n\n What is a program receives a referral for a client that they do not have access do, should they create a new client?\n\n Are there any special requirements for Youth permissions?\n\n R&L Data Architecture\n Please click here to view data architecture needs: R&L Data Architecture . This includes: \n Client and referral data\n OC Links, CAT, O&E, CRP, CSU all share the same client list but OC Warmline and PEI do not\n\n Resource data\n\n Statuses: Will use current statues used in universal referral portals."

A TAR is created when a client is discharged after receiving services for inpatient hospitalization.\n User Research Synthesis \n Pre-build research: \n 2 hospital shadowing sessions\n\n 3 OC HCA shadowing sessions\n\n Product beta testing: \n 2 hospital sessions\n\n 2 OC HCA sessions\n Office Support Staff\n\n Clinical Staff\n\n Key Insights: \n There are different types of TARs, each with different requirements.\n\n Concurrent review is a key part of the process.\n\n Hospital users often do not know what is required to submit a TAR. \"Tribal knowledge\" is invoked, and gives some hospitals an unfair advantage over others.\n\n Clinical staff in OC look for the same key information consistently, but struggle to get that information from some hospitals.\n\n Problem \n The current TAR process is inefficient, outdated, and frustrating for both counties and hospitals. Common challenges include:\n Excessive Documentation: Hospitals often submit more information than necessary, complicating the review process and slowing approvals.\n\n Inconsistent Submission Methods: Hospitals use varying formats and methods for TAR submissions, creating confusion and inefficiencies.\n\n Paper-Based Submissions: Many TARs still rely on physical packets, often sent by mail or courier, leading to delays and lost documents.\n\n Limited Status Transparency: A lack of real-time visibility into TAR status leads to frequent follow-ups between hospitals and county offices, wasting time on both sides.\n\n All of the above issues mean cumbersome submission and review processes and delayed reimbursement to service providers.\n Personas\n Hospital Case Management Staff: Collect all documentation and submit TAR for discharged clients to receive reimbursement for services.\n OC HCA Office Support Staff: Confirms county receipt of the TAR and ensures client Medi-Cal status. Enters client into database. Assigns to OC Clinician for processing. Additionally, sends payment approval to DHCS.\n OC HCA Clinician: Reviews TARs for medical necessity and eligibility. Approves, defers, or denies payment for providers service delivery depending on audit. \n Other:\n Carelon (OC Contractor): Perform concurrent review while client is hospitalized to ensure medical necessity and appropriateness of treatment plan. Authorizes or denies service delivery for clients and sends reports to hospitals and OC HCA.\n Terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n Treatment Authorization Request (TAR)\n In the context of our project with OC, a TAR is created when a client is discharged after receiving services for inpatient hospitalization, and is one of the mechanisms in which DHCS (Department of Health Care Services) approve reimbursement costs to the service provider.\n\n Concurrent Review\n Checking in daily with hospitals to authorize treatment\n\n Retroactive Review\n After a client's stay in hospital, looking over paperwork to confirm correct authorization of treatment\n\n Vision \n The TAR Portal simplifies and digitizes the Treatment Authorization Request process, transforming it into an efficient, transparent platform that streamlines submissions, accelerates processing, and ensures timely reimbursement for Medi-Cal providers.\n Goals\n Eliminate the need for paper TAR packets\n\n Decrease the amount of time spent processing a TAR\n\n Decrease the number of deferrals\n\n Increase the speed of accurate payment to hospitals\n\n Strategy \n We will start with county-contracted providers to validate the product's efficacy before expanding out to additional hospitals.\n\n Success metrics\n Goal \n Metric \n\n Decrease amount of time spent processing a TAR\n Decrease administrative burden for hospitals & OC\n Time from receipt to approval/denial.\n\n User satisfaction.\n\n Decrease number of deferrals\n Rate of deferrals for Chorus submissions vs. non-Chorus.\n\n Increase speed of accurate payment to hospitals\n Time from submission to reimbursement.\n\n Eliminate need for paper storage\n Percentage of TARs received digitally (in Chorus)\n\n entered into Chorus by OC users.\n\n Core Workflow\n https://www.figma.com/board/MWRb5hoHfO2zDtApBswA6N/TAR-Proposal-And-Strategy?node-id=1170-1521&t=uWlLdPFYFfBhsFs5-4 \n Statuses \n Below are the that will be used for the build. Note that the decision of the TAR is only shown as the \"status\" for the hospital user while OC HCA will use \"complete\" no matter what the decision of the TAR is\n Hospital Status \n Description \n\n Draft\n The hospital is assembling the TAR fields with documents\n\n Sent\n The hospital has sent the TAR over to OC HCA\n\n Approved\n OC HCA has approved the TAR\n\n Approved as modified\n OC HCA has approved the TAR, but with some days denied\n\n Deferred\n OC HCA is requesting more information from OC HCA\n\n Denied\n OC HCA has denied all requested days\n\n Archived\n The hospital no longer needs the TAR and wants to remove it from all reporting. This is typically used for testing as well as accidentally created TAR's. \n\n OC HCA Status \n Description \n\n Received\n The hospital has just sent a TAR over to OC HCA\n\n Office Review\n An OC HCA user has started the office review\n\n Clinical Review\n Office review has been completed and a clinician has been assigned to start the clinical review\n\n Final Processing\n Clinical review has completed and the office support staff will now check and review the TAR before sending this back to the hospital.\n\n Complete\n The TAR has been returned back to the hospital.\n\n Void\n The TAR has been voided and should no longer be recognized. This is important for when a replacement TAR is submitted.\n\n Feature Priorities\n Note: please see the roadmap in JPD (linked at the top of this document) for the most up-to-date features and descriptions. \n Must Have \n Features \n Description \n\n TAR Dashboards (Hospital, OC)\n View all new, in progress, and completed TARs\n\n Hospital: Create a new TAR\n Enter necessary client + medical documentation for TARs. \n\n TAR Details Page\n View all client info and medical documentation.\n\n TAR Status Tracking\n Track the live status of the TAR while it is being processed\n\n Office Support: Link TAR to client record\n Link the TAR to a client in the database to allow TAR's to be tracked per client\n\n Office Support: Review and Decision\n Check to see if all documentation has been added before sending to clinical review\n\n Clinician: Review & Decision\n Review the TAR and provide a decision for the authorization\n\n Office Support: Final Processing\n Before sending the review over to hospitals, check the tar one last time.\n\n Should Have \n Features \n Description \n\n OC HCA submit TAR on behalf of hospitals\n Allow OCA to submit TAR's for hospitals that are out of network and will not be using TAR's\n\n E-sign and e-stamp digital TAR forms\n Sign and stamp TAR's digitally to download and send to the state\n\n Automated deferral and denial (NOABD) letters\n Create generated letters to provide a formal communication to hospitals for decisions\n\n Re-submit deferred TAR's\n For TAR's that are deferred, allow hospitals to update documents and resubmit.\n\n Appeal denied TAR's\n Hospital appeals for completed TARs can be submitted through Chorus.\n\n Nice-To-Have \n Features \n Description \n\n Generate fax cover sheets\n When TAR's need to be faxed over, create a cover sheet to go on top of any faxed documents\n\n TUT's\n When a TAR has been submitted to the state, allow users to send a change request.\n\n Replacement TAR's\n For TAR's that need to be replaced due to changing Medi-cal eligibility, allow TAR's to be submitted that can replace TAR's that should be voided.\n\n Mark invoices as received\n For unfunded TAR's that have been approved, track when a hospital has sent an invoice.\n\n Out of scope for launch\n Features \n Description \n\n PDF Parser\n Users can have pdf documents parsed into Chorus fields\n\n eFax\n Users can eFax the signed and stamped completed TARs to the state.\n\n In-app notifications\n Implement elegant notifications to alert users of key activities in processing.\n\n Activity Log\n Users will have a holistic view of the TAR's history.\n\n Concurrent Review\n Contractors who perform concurrent review will be able to enter the results of their reviews in Chorus for OC to easily access."

A UCLA evaluation conducted on DMC-ODS found that the pilot program yielded significant improvements in quality of care within counties that opted into the program, when compared with Drug Medi-Cal (DMC) only counties. UCLA found that participating in DMC-ODS led to an increase in access to treatment by 7 percent, as well as enhanced care coordination and integration with physical health services for DMC-ODS counties. Furthermore, 80 percent of DMC-ODS counties have implemented a Beneficiary Access Line connecting individuals to treatment or referrals, compared to 44 percent of DMC counties. Overall, DMC-ODS services have high patient satisfaction, with 93 percent reporting positive ratings of their treatment. \n In December 2021, DHCS received approval from CMS to reauthorize DMC-ODS, shifting the managed care authority to the consolidated CalAIM 1915(b) waiver and using the Medicaid State Plan to authorize the majority of DMC-ODS benefits. Authority to provide reimbursable Medi-Cal services for DMC-ODS members residing in institutions for mental disease (IMDs) remains in the 1115 demonstration through December 31, 2026. To learn more about DMC-ODS program and updates pursuant to CalAIM, please see BHIN 23-001 .\n Additional resources for DMC-ODS counties, including free assessment tools, can be found on the County Resources page \n Source: https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/provgovpart/Pages/Drug-Medi-Cal-Organized-Delivery-System.aspx \n\n American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) \n Established in 1954, ASAM is a distinguished medical society that encompasses more than 7,500 physicians, clinicians, and related professionals who specialize in addiction medicine. DMC-ODS is modeled after ASAM Criteria for SUD services\n The ASAM Criteria Assessment Interview Guide from DHCS \n\n Bed Board (aka Bed Availability Board) \n Shows availability at different programs, so that referrers (e.g., Police, CAT Team, etc.) know if they can refer a client to a program\n\n Referral \n When a client is given a recommendation in writing to a specific service provider for care and treatment\n\n Linkage \n Client participates at least once in the treatment to which they were referred. Since CRPs are residential stays, \"Linkage\" has been defined as when the client is admitted to the service\n\n Closed Loop Referral \n Referring and receiving providers are able to track the status of a referral and confirm client status between both providers\n\n Authorization for Residential Treatment (ART) \n BHS staff responsible for authorizing residential treatment. ART team staff are healthcare professionals with appropriate clinical expertise in treating the beneficiary's/client's condition or disease\n\n Authorization \n The approval process for DMC-ODS services prior to the submission of a DMC-ODS claim\n\n Withdrawal Management\n\n Residential Treatment\n\n Recovery Residence\n\n Outpatient Clinic\n\n Objective\n Allow programs involved in the current SUD care pathway (ART, Withdrawal management, residential treatment centers, and recovery residences) the ability to digitally receive/record referrals from current sources, review the \n Create a system that allows SUD programs to receive, manage, and send referrals to other OC programs (both county contracted and county operated). This includes the ability to: \n Receive and manage incoming referrals\n\n Send and track outgoing referrals\n\n View bed availability across SUD programs in OC\n\n Broader Context\n Personas\n SUD Supervisor (Maria) \n Goals: Maria wants to be able to care for her client and quickly view and manage all the referrals\n\n Clinician at Phoenix House (Leon) \n Goals: Leon wants to be able to care for his client and help clients find ongoing care after their stay at Phoenix House\n\n Client at Phoenix House \n Goals: Richard wants to work on his mental health by staying at Phoenix House\n\n Permissions\n Functional Workflow - Future state\n For most up to date current and future state functional workflows please see figma: https://www.figma.com/file/jiB7XsMs5F0KfZUHFNT4x9/CRP-Workflow?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=9LGRpyVue4FJitc1-1 \n Critical User Journeys & Requirements\n See Q4 Product Plan for high-level requirements\n https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_gXk4ybpvtzTAQ8TLvD9MuQJhgkOXULGm_-SKvkQyF8/edit \n Dependencies & Questions\n Scope \n I believe that we're building a Bed Board + R&L system (similar to CRP & CSU) for 46 locations within four program types. Is this accurate?\n This also includes ATD + ASAM\n\n Are we also building a patient portal for clients to self-manage their own ATDs?\n\n Workflow \n When in the workflow is the ATD signed?\n\n When in the workflow is the ASAM conducted? \n\n Client List & Permissions \n Can we have one client list across all SUD programs?\n\n Can we have one client list across all MHRS Programs & SUD Programs?\n Which programs (both county operated and county contracted) from MHRS are allowed to see SUD clients? Which programs from MHRS are allowed to see SUD history?\n\n How much information should SUD programs be able to see from other SUD Programs and from MHRS programs?\n\n What is a program receives a referral for a client that they do not have access do, should they create a new client?\n\n How are we going to manage duplicate clients?\n\n Are there any special requirements for Youth permissions\n\n Referrals \n Do programs send referrals to all locations within the program groups (e.g., all 11 locations that provide residential treatment) or do they select a specific location?

This causes clients to get lost in the system without receiving care.\n\n Referrals require providers to send each other multiple back and forth communications , taking time away from client care.\n\n Delayed treatment per client results also results in higher costs related to poor clinical outcomes and readmissions \n\n OC-specific issues:\n Currently, Chorus only supports referrals between OC programs.\n\n Programs outside of OC (Ex: CalOptima, Kaiser) drive high volume of referrals into OC.\n There also exists a high volume of referrals from OC programs to external programs (Ex: CalOptima and Kaiser MCPs)\n\n Personas\n Individual Clients\n Searches for and requests behavioral and mental health services \n\n CalOptima Behavioral Health Coordinators\n Answers phone calls from Medi-cal beneficiaries and determine which level of care to send them to.\n\n Receives incoming transition of care referrals from OC and send them to contracted MCP providers\n\n ASO Coordinators\n Answers phone calls from OC clients and determine which level of care to send them to.\n\n Receives incoming referrals from CalOptima and send them to the correct provider\n\n Adult/Youth intake coordinator\n Manage incoming referral requests to OC MHP's and sends the client to the correct provider based on earliest availability\n\n Adult/Youth MHP provider\n Intake incoming referral requests from various sources to provide treatment\n\n Refer clients to MCP's when they need to transition to a lower level of care.\n\n Before we begin: a note on terminology\n Term \n Definition \n\n Referral\n The process of sending a client from one service provider to another service provider for health care, behavioral health services, and/or other support services, by electronic transmission, in writing, or on the phone, regardless of linkage status.\n\n Linkage\n When a client has attended at least one appointment or made one visit to the identified program(s) or services for which the client has received a referral.\n\n Resource Recommendation\n The process of providing a client with one or more suggested resources, without plans and/or an ability to follow up on Linkage status\n\n MCP \n Managed Care Plans: In California, Medi-Cal covers mental health services through different delivery systems with non-specialty mental health services delivered by Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Plans (MCPs). In Orange County, these are managed by CalOptima and Kaiser.\n California requires MCPs to cover the following mental health services:\n Mental health evaluation and treatment (including individual, group, and family psychotherapy)\n\n Psychological and neurological testing, when clinically indicated to evaluate a mental health condition\n\n Outpatient services for the purposes of monitoring drug therapy\n\n Outpatient laboratory, drugs, supplies, and supplements\n\n Psychiatric consultation\n\n Dyadic care services.\n\n MHP \n Mental Health Plans provided by the county. In California, Medi-Cal covers mental health services through different delivery systems with specialty mental health services delivered by MHP's. In Orange County, these are managed by OC BHS.\n Currently, specialty mental health services covered by MHPs in CA include:\n rehabilitative mental health services (which includes mental health, medication support, day treatment intensive, day rehabilitation, crisis intervention, crisis stabilization, adult residential treatment, crisis residential treatment, and psychiatric health facility services); \n\n psychiatric inpatient hospital services\n\n targeted case management; \n\n psychiatrist services; \n\n psychologist services; • psychiatric nursing facility services; \n\n EPSDT services (including intensive care coordination, intensive homebased services, therapeutic behavioral services, and therapeutic foster care); and \n\n peer support services.\n\n Screening Tool\n Screening Tool - For Medi-Cal beneficiaries that are trying to receive mental health care for the first time \n If the client scores high (>=6) on the Screening Tool they are sent to a OC HCA provider\n\n If the client scores (<6) on the Screening Tool they are sent to a CalOptima provider\n\n Transition of Care Tool\n Transition of Care Tool - For Medi-Cal beneficiaries that need to transition to a different level of care \n After the client has meet with a provider and are ready to transition to a different level of care, then the Transition tool is completed and sent to the new provider\n\n CalOptima\n One of the two county organized health system that provides care for people who have Medi-cal. They provide manage MCP's in Orange County (along with Kaiser)\n\n ASO aka Carelon aka BAL\n Administrative Services Agency. Each county must have an administrative services organization, and Carelon is the ASO for OC BHS. BAL refers to one of the services that an ASO provides, which is a 24/7 Beneficiary Access Line. The ASO provides more than just this service however, as they also provides ongoing development and maintenance of the Mental Health Plan Network of Providers.\n\n CYS\n Children and Youth Services\n\n AOABH\n Adult and Older Adult Behavioral Health (AOABH)\n\n BHIN\n Behavioral Health Information Notice; statewide directive for standardizing services and processes for Mental Health & SUD service delivery\n\n Vision\n The overall aim for a universal referral portal is to support system-wide referrals and linkages throughout the entire OC network. \n\n This includes the support for referral to and from external organization and eventually self referrals through a website navigator.\n\n Goals\n Ensure timely access to care for behavioral and mental health services to clients\n\n Reduce the administrative burden related to phone calls and data entry to support referrals\n\n note EQRO metrics to define timely access to services\n Non-urgent service rendered: 10 days\n\n EQRO metrics to define timely access to services\n Non-urgent service rendered: 10 days\n\n Success metrics\n Goal \n Metric \n\n Ensure timely access to care for behavioral and mental health services to clients\n Time from referral request to appointment offered\n\n Time from referral request to appointment accepted\n\n Time from referral request to linkage \n\n No show rate\n\n Reduce the administrative burden related to phone calls and data entry to support referrals\n Reduce # of emails sent between MHP and MCP programs\n\n Reduce # of phone calls sent between MHP and MCP programs\n\n Staff satisfaction \n\n Referral closure rate (rate in which referral is updated to linked/not linked/not accepted)\n\n Referral accepted rate\n\n Time from referral request to referral closure \n\n Volume of referrals created in Chorus \n\n User Research Synthesis\n 3 Dedicated UXR sessions\n\n 1 In-Person Shadowing\n\n 1 Referrals and Linkages Workshop (OC kickoff)\n\n Ongoing design reviews done periodically\n\n Key Insights:\n Referral pathways can involve more than two programs\n\n Multiple referral pathways exist given multiple different scenarios\n\n End of referral destination isn't determined by the first referral source\n\n Contact attempts and appointments offered are necessary fields to complete for all services\n\n Functional Workflow - Future state\n https://www.figma.com/board/raU80x7EcQ0IYWtgKcZwJv/Universal-Referral-Portal---R%26L-Workflows?node-id=370-704&node-type=canvas&t=MBpWFDQwPXxObrf4-0 \n Feature Priorities\n Must Have Features \n Feature \n Justification \n\n Referral Dashboards\n Users need a view to see incoming referrals to determine which they need to address\n\n Creating and forwarding new referrals\n Intake coordinators need the ability to create new referrals when requested from referral sources and send to different programs based on a variety of circumstances\n\n Attaching documents to referrals\n For all documents that are not digitized, file attachments allows for any relevant files to be passed along the multiple providers.\n\n Live Status Tracking\n Users need to see the history of the referral, including changes to status, notes from other providers, and linkage information.\n\n Support for screening tool\n All MCPs and MHP's require the use of a screening tool as required by DHCS.\n\n Support for Transition of Care tool\n All MCPs and MHP's require the use of a transition of care tool as required by DHCS.\n\n Record Contact Attempts and Offered Appointments\n The state requires reporting on offered appointments to measure timely access to care.\n\n Enabled Permissions per provider\n Referrals should be viewable by each provider\n\n Should Have Features \n Feature \n Justification \n\n Clients Dashboard\n Not needed to support digitized referrals but allows users to search previous referrals by name.\n\n Client Referral History Page\n Not needed to support digitized referrals but allows users to check on referral history per client \n\n Decision guidance for referrals\n Allows users full visibility of suggested referral guidance based on state requirements\n\n Email Notifications\n Allows programs to quickly respond to incoming referrals sent to their dashboard. Referrals can be supported without notifications but this requires users to view dashboard multiple times within a day.\n\n Nice to Have Features\n Feature \n Justification \n\n Print\n Allows users to have referrals documented outside of Chorus. Not crucial to current workflows found in UXR.\n\n Team Member page\n Allows providers to view team members on page and manually update their own profile.\n\n Future Roadmap (currently out of scope for initial launch)\n Feature \n Justification \n\n Integrated referrals and bedboards viewable directly on OC links, O&E, CAT, CRP/CSU\n Initial need is to ensure referrals between mental health clinics work properly in order to support MHP's and MCP's. Given high volume of referrals within MCP's and MHP's, this needs to be de-risked before connecting multiple applications with URP.\n\n Administrative/supervisor views\n Reports on referral tracking analytics as well as overview screens for multiple programs. \n\n Guest portal\n Individual users can manually record incoming referrals which should account for any referral sources not added to URP. However, this needs to be a consideration once Kaiser needs to be added\n\n Kaiser MCP support\n Waiting on OC and Kaiser agreements to be finished"

This supports the case for consistent resource entry and improving the resource interaction UX.\n\n Chorus Platform OC Navigator Data: April 7, 2022 - June, 11 2024\n Problem\n For Chorus: There isn't a consistent and simple resource management framework to offer up to clients purchasing a resource navigator. Chorus staff spend time supporting with resource management and product teams are generally starting from scratch identifying similar requirements for managing resource information. \n For OC HCA: There isn't one simple and user friendly framework in place to manage OC resources used by various apps (OC Nav, OC Links, Warmline, CRP, R&L) leading to resource detail inconsistency and increased administrative time managing resources.\n Personas\n The following are general personas applicable to most resource navigators and can be adjusted as needed to align with the purpose of the app (e.g. demographics).\n Participants (End-Users): Individual looking for resources to get help for themselves or someone else.\n Goals: Easily find appropriate resources for themselves or people they're caring for.\n\n Motivations: To remain healthy or ensure someone they're taking care for is healthy\n\n Frustrations: Resource information may be inconsistent or inaccurate, leading to them not getting the help they need\n\n OC HCA County Administrator: Individual responsible for creating or updating resource information on behalf of their own organization/program\n Goals: Provide accurate, up-to-date, and consistent resource information for participants to engage with\n\n Motivations: Improve client care and reduce county's total health care costs\n\n Frustrations: Lack of central portal to manage resources leads to inconsistent resource information and increased administrative time to discuss resource governance\n\n Vision\n The OC Resource Portal streamlines resource management and powers applications across Orange County, ensuring consistent resource information, saving administrators time, and connecting communities to vital health resources.\n Additionally, a centralized resource portal will be critical to the development of self-referrals as the feature will rely on having a consistent resource framework in place for both client administrators and providers.\n Objectives\n Establish a simple resource management module that can be productized for resource navigators.\n\n Centralize resource management into a unified resource directory\n\n Reduce resource management time for both Chorus and client stakeholders\n\n Improve UX of OC Navigator resource artifacts (resource card & detail page)\n\n Success metrics\n Objectives \n Metric \n\n Centralize resource management into a unified resource directory\n Number of OC departments using the OC Resource Portal\n\n Reduce resource management time for both Chorus and client stakeholders\n Number of OC staff with access to the OC Resource Portal\n\n Reduction in communication between OC and Chorus regarding resource management and review\n\n Average time to create, approve, and publish resource (compare time between current resource portal and OC Resource Portal)\n\n Improve UX of OC Navigator resource artifacts\n Number of resources with consistent formatting and style\n\n User Research Synthesis\n While we've conducted user experience research for the OC Navigator, formal user experience research was not conducted prior to the design and development of the OC Resource Portal. While we were in contact with the client to receive feedback and approval for all of the resource portal designs, as we move towards templates, an opportunity exists for us to conduct more in-depth user experience research for future resource portal builds.\n Functional Workflow\n https://www.figma.com/design/RMOWjHMQ6CH1gnxujIk3QG/OC-Nav-Resource-Portal?node-id=5388-130419&node-type=frame&t=Y8oIe1qUZvDHTJsh-0 \n Feature Priorities\n OC Resource Portal user permissions are described here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q9-8K67iamXCeiOhiiU7v7rQO2I-50F7dZ4Rgs1wjkU/edit# \n\n OC Resource Portal status use cases are described here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQ4Xq721hlFp8ag6j_pDhOw1C1838dMQ9W0Yci8C7ks/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3ssl9c3zxydb \n\n Content Style Guide designs: https://www.figma.com/design/iEY7EzLZAMPOmTud72voiR/OC-Nav-Content-Style-Guide?node-id=255-12626&node-type=frame&t=PJ6KF4zw7IdR958F-0 \n\n Must Have \n Features \n Description \n\n Dashboard\n The Resource Entry Portal dashboard displays all available resources to users of the resource entry portal. It serves as their hub to be able to edit and review resource information that displays in the OC Navigator, OC Warmline and other Referrals and Linkages apps.\n\n Sidebar Navigation\n The Resource Entry Portal should have a sidebar that allows an Editor/Publisher to easily create a new resource, view all resources, and view resource submissions.\n\n Add Resource Workflow\n The Resource Entry Portal should allow for Editor/Publisher to add a new resource or edit an existing one.

These manual efforts were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked the ability to track and monitor referral outcomes efficiently.\n\n Fragmented Systems: Service delivery was often siloed, with different departments or community-based organizations maintaining separate records or systems. This fragmentation created barriers to seamless coordination, follow-up, and integrated care.\n\n Lack of Real-Time Data: Without a centralized platform, it was difficult for OCHCA to access up-to-date information about service demand, client progress, and available resources, making it harder to make data-driven decisions or improve service delivery.\n\n Dispatch Board Before Chorus\n 🗣️ Terminology\n You know what would be helpful when reading this doc? To know what all the words mean.\n Term/Abbreviation \n Explanation \n\n OC Links\n Resource for residents of Orange County, California, that connects individuals with mental health, substance use, and community services. It is part of the Orange County Behavioral Health Services and aims to provide a single point of contact for people seeking help or information about behavioral health resources, including mental health services, addiction recovery support, and community-based programs.\n\n CAT\n The CAT team refers to the Crisis Assessment Team and is part of the broader mental health and emergency response system. This team is specifically trained to provide immediate, on-site support for individuals experiencing mental health crises.\n\n Referral\n When a client is connected directly in writing to a specific service provider for care and treatment\n\n Recommendation\n When a client is verbally recommended and given more information about a specific service provider for care and treatment\n\n Objective\n Provide the OC Links team with the tools necessary to intake calls, create robust client profiles, and provide resources or create digital referrals to optimize resource allocation, ensure timely access to services, and create a centralized database of case and client history to ultimately improve overall client care.\n Digitize the Referral Process: Create a platform to automate and streamline service referrals, reducing manual efforts and ensure timely, accurate connections to resources.\n\n Centralize Data: Consolidate service information into a single system, giving OCHCA real-time insights into service utilization and outcomes.\n\n Improve Coordination and Follow-Up Process: Enable better tracking of client referrals, case / client history, and follow-ups to reduce gaps in client care.\n\n Increase Staff Satisfaction: Provide OC Links / CAT users with a tool that reduces time and frustration in their day to day process.\n\n 🌎 Broader Context\n OC Links, followed by CAT, was one of the first programs launched for the OC client in January 2021. OC Links is currently one of the main entry points into the OCHCA system of care where a call is received, triaged, and escalated to a direct referral, recommendation, or crisis dispatch.\n 🧍Personas\n OC Links Service Chief: Supervisor-level role within the OC Links program.\n Goals: View all cases at any time for supervisor level triaging and quality control. Oversee clinician rotation / assignment; monitor key outcomes / reporting\n\n Motivations: To ensure quality care, response times for clients, and efficient processes for internal teams, data visualization\n\n Frustrations: Resource constraints and efficiency, complex case management, and lack of visibility into higher level scope of cases across a specific time period\n\n OC Links Navigator: Individual responsible for fielding incoming calls and providing necessary resources \n Goals: Provide accurate, up-to-date, and consistent resource information for clients to engage with to ensure a high level of care and timely response\n\n Motivations: Improve client care and reduce county's total health care costs\n\n Frustrations: Issues with resource management tools, such as cumbersome interfaces or manual efforts and difficulty in synchronizing data across multiple systems or platforms, duplicate data entry\n\n CAT Clinician: Accredited Individual going into the field to assess the severity of the crisis and determine the appropriate course of action to stabilize the individual\n Goals: Promptly provide care to clients experiencing a crisis\n\n Motivations: Improve end-user care and prevent crisis escalation\n\n Frustrations: Manual documentation including timestamps or notes; distractions from assessment due to process; difficulty communicating w/ dispatch\n\n CAT Dispatcher: Individual responsible for assigning and dispatching the most readily available clinician to cases as they come in\n Goals: Assess crisis acuity, gather pertinent information, and dispatch optimal team\n\n Motivations: Improve end-user care and provide prompt response to crisis situations\n\n Frustrations: Resource constraints and efficiency, outdated, manual, unreliable processes causing errors and delays, time pressures, and inconsistent resource navigation\n\n User Research Synthesis\n In person shadowing\n\n Ongoing design reviews and program check-ins\n\n CAT Shadowing \n OC Links Shadowing - Aug 2 \n See previous research findings and workflow here: https://www.figma.com/board/JWoBZzV6MvJRNhgY9EdvwR/CAT-Dispatch-Workflows-June-2023?node-id=162-2119&t=5o1vwNMK5hZnMWsx-1 \n 🔀 Functional Workflow: Future State\n TBD \n Success Metrics \n Goal \n Metric \n\n Ensure timely response to triage requests and services for clients\n Reduction in time of the average case from baseline\n\n Time between dispatch request and accept status (Communication efficiency between agencies)\n\n Time between assignment and dispatched status (Dispatch efficiency)\n\n Time between accepted and arrival status (Dispatch efficiency)\n\n Time between unassigned and assigned status (Assignment efficiency and ability to select most readily available clinician(s))\n\n Time between accepted and arrival status (Dispatch efficiency)\n\n High program adoption and usage\n # of incoming referrals (cases)\n\n # of outgoing referrals\n\n # of dispatches\n\n Data integrity\n Reduction in # of duplicate clients over time\n\n Future Roadmap\n Objective: \n Client feedback first - respond to immediate needs of the client to ensure success for the daily users of the application\n\n Build features in line with our template approach to create a best-in-class experience for case triage and crisis response\n\n Update OC Links and CAT to reflect recent learnings and improvements from both a UI and UX perspective \n\n High Level Roadmap Items \n Read-Only: Create a read-only experience for users who merely want to open a case to view without the risk of data overrides. Right now, every user is forced into an edit state causing data collision.\n Geotab / Geolocation Enablement : GPS enabled tracking of cases and clinician vehicles in order to optimize the dispatch process, provide real-time location information to users and clients, and ensure clinician safety in the field.\n Time Stamping (Case Details): Timestamp and show history whenever case details are updated \n One of many future requests for an access log for case edits - seeing a similar request for other clients\n\n Updated CAT Dispatch Logic: Rethink and expand the current dispatch logic for crisis to support up to 4 clinicians, incremental dispatching (only dispatch one person at a time with notifications), tracking of role played in the case, and more.\n CAT Referral: Make a universal ability to create a referral at any time in CAT mobile because referrals are created at any time in the process.\n Rethink High Profile Client: Rethink the process of how the program defines a high profile client vs. a frequent caller to prepare for the automation of functionality in the system based on these flags.\n Next Up Clinician Rotation: Digitize the clinician assignment logic utilized by the program and incorporate into our application when assigning a clinician to a case. Also expand to support case queuing, prioritization, and flagging.\n Goals: \n Provide the OC Links and CAT client with application and design updates that we've successfully implemented for other clients\n Improves data organization, organizes core workflow, and further optimizes crisis response which are all goals for the client\n\n Roadblocks: \n There is currently a growing divergence between the OC product and what we are building for future clients (MOConnect) that is making what we create for OC very specific to this client and outdated \n\n OC Links is a 24/7 application with no downtime and very little flexibility for training up on new features making updates difficult from a program level\n\n Potential Next Steps: \n Decouple dispatch and case creation\n Most calls do not result in a crisis dispatch\n\n Will allow us to update each workflow and application separately and more easily in the future\n\n Implement NEW crisis dispatch workflow created for MOConnect / Merced\n Client search, intake, duplicate client check, assignment flow\n\n Update case creation and management workflow to replicate R&L, O&E, and other OC applications\n\n Create future features in unification with our growing template for case management and crisis response\n\n Opportunity: \n There is currently a program shift in the OC Links and CAT programs with leadership changing, so this may be the perfect time to discuss these potential benefits and next steps with the client to build an updated roadmap for 2025+.\n\n We've previously valued OC Links as an area for R&D where we learn from the features built that translate to future clients. With this divergence, we're losing out on that R&D value because the features are less repeatable.\n We have an opportunity to get to a place where R&D in OC Links and CAT is valuable again starting with the steps above. \n\n Requirements \n See epics and related stories for most up-to-date details.\n Epics \n\n https://chorusapp.atlassian.net/issues/WMB-77?jql=text%20~%20%22geotab%2A%22 \n\n Future epics will be added here as they are created.\n\n Program Specific Questions \n See the Referral Information Form confluence page for all program specific questions.\n 🚦Statuses\n https://www.figma.com/board/EprYbsNopmnathUoGWew7g/OC-Statuses?node-id=360-140&t=BBVPHmojA9ayhzE5-1 \n Files\n Previous project plan Project Plan: CAT Dispatch Improvements \n\n OC Links Designs https://www.figma.com/design/EUiZINndmwTyZh1obNEYQk/OC-Links?m=auto&node-id=0-1&t=KPxgPt5giOWCtazI-1 \n\n CAT Designs https://www.figma.com/design/YGj4MzJerdVGS1KDR1HCq3/CAT-Mobile?node-id=0-1&t=QNMTyEYGp8v5ApMC-1 \n\n Next steps\n\n 3 \n 3 \n incomplete \n\n Open Questions\n Question \n Answer \n Answerer \n Answered on"

    "content": "User Story\n As a CARECourt user I want to be able to add monthly surveys before the client has had their official CARE petition in court because sometimes clients have to wait awhile for their court date. \n Justification \n Since the app is already built, we can't really start from scratch with this workflow\n\n All CLR apps are built with the assumption that we are creating a referral/case/petition object and attributing information to that object. There isn't a current build where we are adding information related to a referral/case/petition before that object is created. \n\n This workflow is not for the majority of clients, its a fairly rare case but one that needs to be accommodated for anyways. Individuals who end up in \"pre-petition\" status are referrals from MIST, FIST or AOT. \n\n To avoid a major overhaul, we're proposing to provide an option to bypass the required petition information until after the \"pre-petition\" phase is over (when client moves to \"pending\"). \n Pros: \n Able to add pre-petition information to client \n\n Can attribute pre-petition information to fully filled out petition later \n\n Quicker to implement \n\n Keeps pre-petition information for separate petitions separate, should the client be re-entered into CARE program at a later time. \n\n Trade-offs: \n Can have multiple \"empty\" petitions (petitions with no case IDs) floating around if the client never makes it to their court date. \n\n Wording doesn't really fit user's actual workflow (pre-petition insinuates that information is collected before the petition is even created) \n\n Could have a more robust build for this but requires lots of dev time that we don't really have. \n\n Open Questions: \n What happens if client ghosts or disappears after pre-petition? Can we move to terminated without ever filling out the petition? \n A: This is a scenario that can happen. They don't progress to another status type they just stop doing the petitions. \n\n Workflow \n Current Workflow \n User clicks CTA to create new petition\n\n Users enters client information \n Can be new client (PIF) \n\n Can also be existing client \n\n User enters petition information*\n Petition information is required to proceed\n Petition Case Number\n\n Original Petitioner\n\n CARE Petition Filing Date\n\n Date Court Ordered Investigation\n\n County Assigned to Investigate/Follow Client \n\n User is taken to petition overview page where they can then add surveys to set petition status \n\n Proposed Change - Add CTA to Petition Information page to bypass those required fields des \n User clicks CTA to create new petition\n\n Users enters client information \n Can be new client (PIF) \n\n Can also be existing client \n\n User sees the Petition Information page\n\n User clicks CTA for pre-petition flow\n\n Chorus creates empty petition shell \n Shell has no case information or other petition data. \n\n Chorus redirects user to petition details view page\n\n User clicks new monthly survey \n User selects \"pre-petition\" status \n\n User completes \"pre-petition\" survey\n\n Client moves into \"pending\" status (outside of Chorus)\n\n User adds new monthly survey to move client from \"pre-petition\" to \"pending\" \n\n VALIDATION CHECK\n On new monthly survey flow, if Status = / = Pre-Petition\n AND petition does not have petition data (case ID) \n Display petition information page and do not allow to progress until completed \n\n CTA to bypass petition information is hidden when status = / = pre-petition\n\n Petition information: \n Petition Case Number\n\n Original Petitioner\n\n CARE Petition Filing Date\n\n Date Court Ordered Investigation\n\n County Assigned to Investigate/Follow Client \n\n Petitioner Information\n Name\n\n Number\n\n Email\n\n Upon completion of petition information, user is then taken to \"pending\" survey\n\n Client proceeds as normal through app. \n\n The next time they fill out a \"pending\" or other survey, they will not need to fill out petition information if its already been completed. \n\n Workflow Diagram \n https://www.figma.com/board/Ax596jdSRNBFBI7pXQMMRn/Maddie-Sandbox?node-id=0-1&t=3hIDAfECUl4tfJv1-1 Requirements \n User can bypass petition information screen on petition creation \n CTA to bypass is only displayed on petition creation \n\n If user clicks \"edit petition information\" at any other time, the CTA is hidden \n\n When user clicks CTA to bypass petition information\n They are redirected to the petition overview and do not need to fill out petition information. \n\n When user initiates new monthly survey and selected survey status = pre-petition\n User is navigated to pre-petition survey and can fill it out and complete it. \n\n When user initiates new monthly survey and selected survey status = / = pre-petition\n user is forced to fill out petition information (case id etc.) \n\n CTA to bypass is hidden \n\n When user initiates new monthly survey and selected survey status = / = pre-petition\n and petition information is filled out \n\n Then they don't see that screen anymore and proceed directly to their selected status's survey"

Within their SUD Residential System, there are four categories: perinatal, withdrawal management, recovery residences, and residential. Providers may offer one of these categories of treatment or multiple categories within their locations. Each category also has it's own bed management system where bed availability is reported to the county regularly, so the county can refer clients to these services. In order to manage beds effectively, bed boards need to provide specific information such what type of client can be placed within a bed, how long a bed is expected to be occupied, when each bed information was last updated (e.g., using timestamps), etc. \n Requirements\n Management \n View open and full beds for each provider at each location\n Timestamp of when bed board was last updated by the provider \n\n Type of client that should be placed in the bed (e.g., ASAM score, gender, etc.)\n\n View how many clients at each facility were sent by ART\n\n Bed boards are arranged into three different populations: \n Withdrawal management (WM) \n\n Perinatal \n\n Residential (RT)\n\n Recovery Residences (RR)\n\n To replace the slots (nice to have) \n Future availability\n\n Gender\n\n Notes\n\n Providers\n Update bed counts \n Full Beds\n\n Open Beds \n\n Capture timestamp of when bed board was last updated \n\n Provider admin can set total (max) number of beds for the facility\n\n Options"
